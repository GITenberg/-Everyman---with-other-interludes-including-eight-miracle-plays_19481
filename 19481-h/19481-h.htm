<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>By craftsmen and mean men, these pageants are played,<br />
And to commons and countrymen accustomably before:<br />
If better men and finer heads now come, what can be said?</p></blockquote>



<p>The pageants of the old English town-guilds, and the other mysteries and
interludes that follow, have still an uncommon reality about them if we
take them in the spirit in which they were originally acted. Their
office as the begetters of the greater literary drama to come, and their
value as early records, have, since Sharp wrote his <i>Dissertation on the
Coventry Mysteries</i> in 1816, been fully illustrated. But they have
hardly yet reached the outside reader who looks for life and not for
literary origins and relations in what he reads. This is a pity, for
these old plays hide under their archaic dress the human interest that
all dramatic art, no matter how crude, can claim when it is touched with
our real emotions and sensations. They are not only a primitive
religious drama, born of the church and its feasts; they are the genuine
expression of the town life of the English people when it was still
lived with some exuberance of spirits and communal pleasure. As we read
them, indeed, though it be in cold blood, we are carried out of our
book, and set in the street or market-square by the side of the "commons
and countrymen," as in the day when Whitsuntide, or Corpus Christi,
brought round the annual pageantry to Chester, Coventry, York, and other
towns.</p>

<p>Of the plays that follow, six come from the old town pageants,
reflecting in their variety the range of subject and the contemporary
effect of the cycles from which they are taken. They are all typical,
and show us how the scenes and characters of the east were mingled with
the real life of the English craftsmen and townsfolk who acted them, and
for whose pleasure they were written. Yet they give us only a small
notion of the whole interest and extent of these plays. We gain an idea
of their popularity both from the number of them given in one town and
the number of places at which regular cycles, or single pageants, were
represented from year to year. The York plays alone that remain are
forty-eight in all; the Chester, twenty-four or five; the Wakefield,
thirty-two or three. Even these do not represent anything like the full
list. Mr. E. K. Chambers, in an appendix to his <i>Medi&aelig;val Stage</i>, gives
a list of eighty-nine different episodes treated in one set or another
of the English and Cornish cycles. Then as to the gazette of the many
scattered places where they had a traditional hold: Beverley had a cycle
of thirty-six; Newcastle-on-Tyne and Norwich, each one of twelve; while
the village and parochial plays were almost numberless. In Essex alone
the list includes twenty-one towns and villages, though it is fair to
add that this was a specially enterprising shire. At Lydd and New
Romney, companies of players from fourteen neighbouring towns and
villages can be traced in the local records that stretch from a year or
so before, to eight years after, the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>Mrs. J. R. Green, in her history of <i>Town Life</i> in that century, shows
us how the townspeople mixed their workday and holiday pursuits, their
serious duties with an apparent "incessant round of gaieties." Hardly a
town but had its own particular play, acted in the town hall or the
parish churchyard, "the mayor and his brethren sitting in state." In
1411 there was a great play, <i>From the Beginning of the World</i>, played
in London at the Skinner's Well. It lasted seven days continually, and
there were the most part of the lords and gentles of England. No copy of
this play exists, but of its character we have a pretty sensible idea
from various other plays of the Creation handed down from the
north-country cycles. In the best of them the predestined Adam is
created after a fashion both to suggest his treatment by Giotto in the
medallion at Florence, and his lineaments as an English medi&aelig;val
prototype:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"But now this man that I have made,<br />
With the ghost of life, I make him glad,<br />
Rise up, Adam, rise up rade,<sup><a href="#fn_1" id="fna_1">1</a></sup><br />
A man full of soul and life!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But to surprise the English medi&aelig;val smith or carpenter, cobbler or
bowyer, when he turns playgoer at Whitsuntide, assisting at a play
which expressed himself as well as its scriptural folk, we must go on to
later episodes. The Deluge in the Chester pageant, that opens the
present volume, has among its many Noah's Ark sensations, some of them
difficult enough to mimic on the pageant-wagon, a typical recall of the
shipwright and ark-builder. God says to Noah:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A ship soon thou shalt make thee of trees, dry and light.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little chambers therein thou make,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And binding pitch also thou take,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within and out, thou ne slake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To anoint it thro' all thy might.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the York Noah's Ark pageant, which seems to be the parent-play in
England of all its kind, we have this craftsman's episode much enlarged.
"Make it of boards," God says, "and wands between!"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thus thriftily and not over thin,<br />
Look that thy seams be subtly seen<br />
And nail&eacute;d well, that they not twin:<br />
Thus I devised it should have been;<br />
Therefore do forth, and leave thy din</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, after further instructions, Noah begins to work before the
spectators, first rough-hewing a plank, then trying it with a line, and
joining it with a gynn or gin. He says:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More subtilely can no man <i>sew</i>;<sup><a href="#fn_2" id="fna_2">2</a></sup><br />
It shall be clinched each ilk and deal,<br />
With nails that are both noble and new,<br />
Thus shall I fix it to the keel:<br />
Take here a rivet, and there a screw,<br />
With there bow,<sup><a href="#fn_3" id="fna_3">3</a></sup> there now, work I well,<br />
This work, I warrant both good and true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To complete the pedigree of this scene we must turn to the old poem, the
"Cursor Mundi," which, written in the fourteenth century, the time when
the northern miracle-plays were taking decisive shape, appears to have
served their writers as a stock-book. The following passage is own
brother to that in the York miracle-play:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A ship must thou needs dight,<br />
Myself shall be the master-wright.<br />
I shall thee tell how broad and long,<br />
Of what measure and how strong.<br />
When the timber is fastened well,<br />
Wind the sides ever each and deal.<br />
Bind it first with balk and band,<br />
And wind it then too with good wand.<br />
With pitch, look, it be not thin!<br />
Plaster it well without and in!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The likeness we see is startling: so near to the other indeed as to
suggest almost a common authorship.</p>

<p>As for the pastoral plays in the same towns, we find the shepherds and
countrymen were just as well furnished with rough cuts from the life.
The most real and frankly illustrative, and by no means the least
idyllic of them is perhaps the Chester play of the three shepherds. It
was not played by countrymen but by townsmen, like the other plays in
the town cycles, being in this case the "Paynters and Glasiors" play.
The first shepherd who opens it talks of the "bower" or cote he would
build, his "sheep to shield," his "seemly wethers to save:"--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From comely Conway unto Clyde<br />
Under tyldes<sup><a href="#fn_4" id="fna_4">4</a></sup> them to hide<br />
A better shepherd on no side<br />
No earthly man may have<br />
For with walking weary I have methought<br />
Beside thee such my sheep I sought<br />
My long-tail'd tups are in my thought<br />
Them to save and heal</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the <i>Death of Abel</i>, another Chester play, Cain comes in with a
plough, and says:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A tiller I am, and so will I be,<br />
As my daddy hath taught it me<br />
I will fulfil his lore</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the subsequent incident of the corn that Cain is to offer for his
sacrifice, we hear the plain echo of the English farmer's voice in the
corn-market mixing with the scriptural verse: "This standing corn that
was eaten by beasts," will do:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>God, thou gettest no better of me,<br />
Be thou never so grim</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So throughout the plays the folk-life of their day, their customs and
customary speech, are for ever emerging from the biblical scene.</p>

<p>In trying to realise how the miracle-plays were mounted and acted, we
shall find the best witness at Chester. This was a rather late one.
Archdeacon Rogers, who saw them in 1594, when they had been going on for
something like three centuries in all. From his account (in the
<i>Harleian Miscellany</i>) it appears the Chester plays were given on
Whit-Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.</p>

<p>"The manner of these plays were, every company had his pageant or part,
a high scaffold with two rooms, a higher and a lower, upon four wheels.
In the lower they apparelled themselves, and in the higher room they
played, being all open on the top, that all beholders might hear and see
them." They were played, he goes on to say, in every street:</p>

<p>"They began first at the abbey gates, and when the first pageant was
played, it was wheeled to the high cross before the mayor, and so to
every street. So every street had a pageant playing before it at one
time, till all the pageants for the day appointed were played. When one
pageant was near ended, word was brought from street to street, that so
they might come in place thereof, exceeding orderly, and all the streets
have their pageants before them, all at one time playing together, to
see which plays was great resort and also scaffolds and stages made in
the streets in those places where they determined to play their
pageants."</p>

<p>The same writer explains elsewhere that these plays were divided into
twenty-four pageants, according to the number of the city companies, and
that each company brought out its own pageant.</p>

<p>At York, whose plays Miss L. Toulmin Smith edited in 1887, we can turn
to Davies's two books<sup><a href="#fn_5" id="fna_5">5</a></sup> and the local records, to complete the Chester
description. Those who travel to York by rail to-day, and there
dismount, as most of us have often done, to walk through the city to the
cathedral, will be interested to find that the railway station now
stands where once was Pageant Green. Near it was formerly another kind
of station, where stood the houses hired to keep the pageants stored and
put away from one year's show to another. The word "pageant," (<i>pagina</i>,
or plank), we ought to recall, was used for the stage, or wheeled car of
two stories, before it was used for the show set forth upon it. Davies
helps us, as we perambulate York to-day, to mark where the old pageants
were performed in 1399, at twelve stations, which were fixed and stated
beforehand. The first station was at the gates of the Priory of the Holy
Trinity in Mickle Gate, and the pageants were moved on them in turn to
places at Skelder Gate end, North Street, Conyng Strete, Stane Gate and
the gates of the Minster, so to the end of Girdler Gate; while the last
of all was "upon the pavement." But the stations were subject to change,
and there was much competition among wealthy householders (one of whom
may have been the Robert Harpham mentioned in a 1417 list) to have the
pageant played before their windows. The highest bidder gained the
coveted right.</p>

<p>Before the actual day came, a town-crier was sent round the city to
proclaim the "banes" or banns.<sup><a href="#fn_6" id="fna_6">6</a></sup> Arms were forbidden: "We command that
no man go armed in this city with swords ne with carlill-axes, in
disturbance of the king's peace and the play, or hindering of the
procession of Corpus Christi, and that they leave their harness in their
inns, saving knights and squires of worship that ought to have swords
borne after them!" The plays began betimes. We read that at York the
players were to be ready "at the mid-hour betwixt the IVth and Vth of
the clock in the morning." Finally, for the players themselves, care was
taken to secure good ones for the several parts. Sometimes a player
doubled or trebled the characters in a particular play.</p>

<p>All through the XIVth and XVth centuries miracle-plays went on
being performed regularly, or irregularly, in most of the English
towns and larger villages. One of the smaller cycles was that of
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, played at Corpus Christi, from 1426 onwards. <i>The
Three Kings of Cologne</i> is mentioned in 1536, which the goldsmiths,
plumbers, glaziers, and others were to play. Here the pageants were not
movable ones, but were given at fixed points. No doubt some of the spots
associated with the Whitsuntide "shuggy-shows" (as I remember them in my
time) were originally show-grounds of the town pageants too. Only one
play of the Newcastle series has survived, and that fitly enough, having
regard to the Tyneside shipbuilding, is a shipwrights' play. Unluckily
it has been so modernised that not a vestige of the local colour or
Tyneside dialect remains.</p>

<p>We come now to the date and origin of these town pageants. Of the three
chief cycles earliest mention is to be found at Chester, and it carries
us doubtfully back to 1268. Sir John Arnway was mayor in that year,
according to one account: but the name recurs pretty positively in
1327-8, and about that time Randall Higgenet, a monk of Chester Abbey,
wrote the plays. But in the text handed down they are of a much later
style of diction, and no doubt later in date than the Towneley or York
series.</p>

<p>About the real origin of these plays there can be no question. They
began in the churches as liturgy plays, which were given at the
Christmas, Easter, and other festivals, illustrating in chief the birth,
life, death and passion of Christ. We owe to Professor Skeat the
recovery of some fragments of liturgical plays in Latin, which have been
reprinted by Professor Manly, in his <i>Specimens of the Pre-Shaksperean
Drama</i>. The earliest example there is may be dated as early as 967, an
important landmark for us, as it is often assumed that we have no
dramatic record of any kind in these islands earlier than the Norman
Conquest. Another generation or two of research, such as the pioneer
work of Dr. Furnivall and the Early English Text Society has made
possible, and we shall distinguish clearly the two lines of growth,
French and Norman, English and Saxon, by which the town-pageants and
folk-plays of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries came to a head.
Then the grafting of the English pastoral on the church-play, after it
had been carried out into the open town or market-place, may become
clear. Then, too, one will know how charged with potential dramatic life
was the mind of him who wrote that interlude in four lines of the "Three
Queens and the Three Dead Men," which contains in it the essence of a
thousand moralities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>1st Queen.</i> I am afeard.</p>

<p><i>2nd Queen.</i> Lo, what I see?</p>

<p><i>3rd Queen.</i> Me thinketh it be devils three!</p>

<p><i>1st Dead Body.</i> I was well fair</p>

<p><i>2nd Dead Body.</i> Such shall thou be.</p>

<p><i>3rd Dead Body.</i> For Godes love, be-ware by me!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These breathe, not a Norman, but an Anglo-Saxon fantasy, and they speak
for themselves. But many tell-tale documents exist to mark the
concurrent Norman and English development that went on in the English
medi&aelig;val literature, and was seen and felt in the church and guild
plays, just as it went on in the towns themselves. It finds at last its
typical expression in an interlude like the Coventry Nativity-play,
reprinted in this volume. Long before the miracle-play was written in
the form it finally took, and about the time when William of Rouen,
after much trouble with his son Robert culminating at the battle of
Gerberoi, was about to return to England, the new opening in the church
in this country became one to tempt poor foreign students of some parts
and some ambition. Among these was a graduate of the University of
Paris, one Geoffrey, known to us now as Geoffrey of St. Albans. He had
been offered the post of master of the abbey school at that place, but
when he arrived after some delay--due perhaps to his going to see a
mystery play at Paris--he found the post filled up. He then made his way
to Dunstable, and while there proved his spirit by getting up a
miracle-play of "Sancta Katarina." He borrowed copes from St. Albans in
which to dress the actors; unluckily a fire took place, and the costumes
were burnt. Thereupon he seems to have rendered himself up as it were in
pious pledge for their loss, for he became a monk. In 1119 he was
elected abbot, and if we give him about twenty-one years in which to
rise to that dignity, we can date the St. Katharine play at 1098 or 9.
This passage in a life of that time is a clue to the further history of
the religious play in England. Geoffrey's attempt to present one at
Dunstable, no doubt a reproduction of one he had seen in France, is an
instance of the naturalisation process that slowly went on.</p>

<p>The distinct break in the history of the miracle-play that made it from
a church into a town pageant occurred about the close of the thirteenth
century. From a performance within the church building it went on then
into the church-yard, or the adjoining close or street, and so into the
town at large. The clerics still kept a hand in its purveyance; but the
rise of the town guilds gave it a new character, a new relation to the
current life, and a larger equipment. The friendly rivalry between the
guilds, and the craftsmen's pride in not being outdone by other crafts,
helped to stimulate the town play, till at length the elaborate cycle
was formed that began with sunrise on a June morning, and lasted until
the torch-bearers were called out at dusk to stand at the foot of the
pageant.</p>

<p>The earliest miracle-plays that we can trace in the town cycles date
back to the early years of Edward III. The last to be performed in
London, according to Prynne, was <i>Christ's Passion</i>, which was given in
James I.'s reign. It was produced "at Ely House, Holborn, when Gundomar
lay there on Good Friday at night, at which there were thousands
present." This was a late survivor, however, called to life by a last
flicker of court sunshine on the occasion of the state visit of a
Spanish ambassador. Here is an extreme range of over three centuries;
and the old religious drama was still being performed in a more and more
uncertain and intermittent fashion all through the dramatic reign of
Shakspeare.</p>

<p>The ten plays that follow in this volume represent in brief the late
remnant of this early drama, rescued at the point where it was ending
its primitive growth, soon to give way to plays written with a
consciously artistic sense of the stage. They are headed by the great
and simple tragic masterpiece, in which they say their last word: the
morality of <i>Everyman</i>, the noblest interlude of death the religious
imagination of the middle ages has given to the stage. The two following
Old Testament plays, <i>The Deluge</i> and the <i>Sacrifice of Isaac</i>, are the
third and fourth pageants in the Chester series; played respectively by
the Water-Leaders and Drawers of the river Dee, and by the Barbers and
Wax-Chandlers. The next is from Coventry, a Nativity play, played by the
Shearmen and Tailors. From the Wakefield series, preserved in the
Towneley collection, we have three plays, the famous second shepherds'
play, with the <i>Crucifixion</i> and the <i>Harrowing of Hell</i>, or extraction
of souls from Hell (<i>Extractio Animarum ab Inferno</i>). Two Cornish
mysteries of the Resurrection are included: <i>The Three Maries at the
Tomb</i>, and <i>Mary Magdalen bringing the News to the Apostles</i>. Then
follows Bishop Bale's oracular play of <i>God's Promises</i>, which is in
effect a series of seven interludes strung on one thread, united by one
leading idea, and one protagonist, the <i>Pater C&oelig;lestis</i>.</p>

<p>In these religious and moral interludes, the dramatic colouring, however
crude, is real and sincere. The humours of a broad folk-comedy break
through the scriptural web continually in the guild plays like those in
which Noah the shipbuilder, or the proverbial three shepherds, appear in
the pageant. Noah's unwilling wife in the Chester <i>Deluge</i>, and Mak's
canny wife in the Wakefield shepherd's play, where the sheep-stealing
scenes reveal a born Yorkshire humorist, offer a pair of gossips not
easy to match for rude comedy. Mak's wife, like the shepherd's in the
same pastoral, utters proverbs with every other breath: "A woman's avyse
helpys at the last!" "So long goys the pott to the water, at last comys
it home broken!"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now in hot, now in cold,<br />
Full woeful is the household,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That wants a woman!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And her play upon the old north-country asseveration, "I'll eat my
bairn,"--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If ever I you beguiled,<br />
That I eat this child<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That lies in this cradle,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(the child being the stolen sheep), must have caused towns-folk and
country-folk outrageous laughter. Mak's wife is indeed memorable in her
way as the Wife of Bath, Dame Quickly, or Mrs. Gamp.</p>

<p>There is nothing so boldly drawn in the Coventry <i>Nativity</i>. But there
you have a startlingly realistic treatment joined to an emotional
lyricism of the simplest charm:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Neither in halls, nor yet in bowers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born would he not be<br />
Neither in castles, nor yet in towers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That seemly were to see.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As I outrode this enderes night<br />
Of three jolly shepherds, I saw a sight;<br />
And all about their fold a star shone bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They sang "Terli, terlow!"<br />
So merrily the shepherds their pipes can blow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this Coventry play we have nearly all the ingredients--foreign,
liturgical, or homely English--of the composite miracle play brought
together. It bears traces of many hands; and betrays in the dialogue of
the formal characters the rubricated lines of the church play on which
it was based. The chief characters live, move and act their recognised
parts with the certainty of the folk in a nursery tale. Herod out-Herods
himself with a Blunderbore extravagance:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am the cause of this great light and thunder;<br />
It is through my fury that they such noise do make.<br />
My fearful countenance, the clouds so doth incumber<br />
That oftentimes for dread thereof, the very earth doth quake.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Fee, fi, fo, fum!" might be the refrain of this giant's litany. The
other types are as plainly stamped. The shepherd's are from the life,
and contrast well with the stilted and rather tiresome prophets. The
scenes at the babe's crib when the offerings are made of the shepherds'
pipe, old hat, and mittens, are both droll and tender.</p>

<p>The tragic counterparts of these scenes are those where the Three
Executioners work their pitiless task to an end at the Crucifixion, or
where the Three Maries go to the grave afterwards in the Cornish
mystery, or where Isaac bids his father bind his eyes that he shall not
see the sword. It was for long the fashion to say, as Sir Walter Scott
did, that these plays had little poetic life, or human interest in them.
But they are, at their best, truly touched with essential emotions, with
humour, terror, sorrow, pity, as the case may be. Dramatically they are
far more alive at this moment, than the English drama of the
mid-nineteenth century.</p>

<p>In the Cornish mysteries we lose much by having to use a translation.
But something of the spirit and life survive in spite of it, and one
detached passage from another of the plays, that of the <i>Crucifixion</i>,
is printed in the appendix, which loses nothing by being compared with
the treatment in other miracle-plays. Also in the Appendix will be found
an interesting note from Norris's <i>Ancient Cornish Drama</i>, on the mode
in which the Cornish mysteries were played; and a brief account by Mr.
Jenner of the trilogy contained in that work.</p>

<p>There remains John Bayle's play of <i>God's Promises</i>. Its author was born
at the sea-doomed city of Dunwich in Suffolk, in 1495. Destined for the
church, he showed his obstinacy early by marrying in defiance of his
cloth. He was lucky and unlucky in being a <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of Thomas
Cromwell, and had to fly the country on that dangerous agent's death.
He returned when the new order was established, and became Bishop of
Ossory, had to suffer and turn exile for his tenets again in Mary's
reign; but found safe harbourage for his latter years at Canterbury,
where he died. He wrote, on his own evidence, more than twenty plays, of
which <i>God's Promises</i>, the <i>Life of John the Baptist</i>, and <i>King John</i>,
a history play of interest as a pioneer, are best known. He himself
called <i>God's Promises</i> a tragedy, but unless the sense of Sodom hanging
in the balance, while Abraham works down to its lowest point the
diminishing ratio of the just to be found there, or of David's appearing
before the Pater C&oelig;lestis as the great judge, of dramatic or tragic
emotion there is little indeed. But Bayle's rhetoric easily ran to the
edge of suspense, as in the opening of his seventh act, where he puts
the dramatic question in the last line:--</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have with fearcenesse mankynde oft tymes corrected,<br />
And agayne I have allured hym by swete promes.<br />
I have sent sore plages, when he hath me neglected,<br />
And then by and by, most confortable swetnes.<br />
To wynne hym to grace, bothe mercye and ryghteousnes<br />
I have exercysed, yet wyll he not amende.<br />
Shall I now lose hym, or shall I hym defende?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And what could be finer than the setting he gives to the antiphon, <i>O
Oriens Splendor</i>, at the end of the second act?</p>

<p>To turn from Bayle's play to the heart-breaking realities of <i>Everyman</i>
is like turning from a volume of all too edifying sermons to the last
chapters of one of the gospels. Into the full history of this play,
opening a difficult question about the early relations between Dutch and
English writers and printers, there is no room here to go. The Dutch
<i>Everyman</i>--<i>Elckerlijk</i>--was in all probability the original of the
English, and it was certainly printed a few years earlier. Richard
Pynson, who first imprinted the English play at the Sign of the George
in Fleet Street, was printing at his press there from the early years of
the sixteenth century. The play itself may have been written, and first
performed, in English, as in Dutch, a generation or more before.</p>

<p>It was written, no doubt, like most of the plays in this volume, by a
churchman; and he must have been a man of profound imagination, and of
the tenderest human soul conceivable. His ecclesiastical habit becomes
clear enough before the end of the play, where he bids Everyman go and
confess his sins. Like many of the more poignant scenes and passages in
the miracle-plays that follow it, this morality too leaves one
exclaiming on how good a thing was the plain English of the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries.</p>

<p>The relation of the several miracle-plays here printed to the
town-cycles from which they come will be seen at a glance on reference
to the tables of pageants that appear in the Appendix. We may take it
that all these town and country plays represent continually used and
frequently tinkered texts, that must in some cases have passed through
many piecemeal changes. In making them easy to the average reader of
to-day, who takes the place of the medi&aelig;val playgoer at a Corpus Christi
festival, their latest copyists have but followed in the wake of a
series of Tudor scribes who renewed the prompt-books from time to time.
In this process, apart from the change of spelling, the smallest
possible alteration has been made consistent with the bringing of the
text to a fair modern level of intelligibility. Old words that have been
familiarised in Malory or Shakespeare, or the Bible, or in the Border
Ballads and north-country books, or in Walter Scott, or the modern
dialect of Yorkshire, are usually allowed to stand, and words needed to
keep the rhyme, are left intact. But really hard words, likely to delay
the reader, are glossed. One Towneley play, the <i>Extractio Animarum</i>,
another and a most spirited example of the "Harrowing of Hell,"
mysteries that thrilled the people long ago, is given in the original
spelling, as some test of the change effected in the others. Further, in
the Appendix will be found a late example of a <i>St. George and the
Dragon</i> doggerel Christmas play, which comes from Cornwall, and which in
a slightly varying form has been played in many shires, from Wessex to
Tyneside, within living memory. This shows us the last state of the
traditional mystery, and the English folk-play as it became when it was
left to the village wits and playwrights to produce it, without any
co-operation from the trained eye and hand of a parson or a learned
clerk. Of some other forms of our earlier drama, not omitting the Welsh
interludes of Twm o'r Nant, it may be possible to give illustrations in
a later book, companion to this. Only so much is given here as may
interest the reader, who is a playgoer first of all, and asks for
entertainment and a light in these darker passages of the old British
drama.</p>

<hr />

<p>Finally the amplest acknowledgments are due to those who have worked
upon these present plays, including Mrs. C. Richardson, M.A., Mr.
O'Brien, Mr. Roberts, Miss Hawkins, G. R., and Mr. Ezra Pound; and to
the various editors of the "Early English Text Society," who have made
this book possible. Especially should tribute be paid to Dr. Furnivall
for his permission to make use of the Society's texts, and his interest
in this uncertain attempt to capture the outer public too, and attract
it to that ever-living literature to which he has devoted so many days
of his young old-age.</p>

<h2>EVERYMAN</h2>

<blockquote><p>HERE BEGINNETH A TREATISE HOW THE HIGH FATHER OF HEAVEN SENDETH
     DEATH TO SUMMON EVERY CREATURE TO COME AND GIVE ACCOUNT OF THEIR
     LIVES IN THIS WORLD AND IS IN MANNER OF A MORAL PLAY.</p></blockquote>


<p><i>Messenger.</i> I pray you all give your audience,<br />
And hear this matter with reverence,<br />
By figure a moral play--<br />
The <i>Summoning of Everyman</i> called it is,<br />
That of our lives and ending shows<br />
How transitory we be all day.<br />
This matter is wondrous precious,<br />
But the intent of it is more gracious,<br />
And sweet to bear away.<br />
The story saith,--Man, in the beginning,<br />
Look well, and take good heed to the ending,<br />
Be you never so gay!<br />
Ye think sin in the beginning full sweet,<br />
Which in the end causeth thy soul to weep,<br />
When the body lieth in clay.<br />
Here shall you see how <i>Fellowship</i> and <i>Jollity</i>,<br />
Both <i>Strength</i>, <i>Pleasure</i>, and <i>Beauty</i>,<br />
Will fade from thee as flower in May.<br />
For ye shall hear, how our heaven king<br />
Calleth <i>Everyman</i> to a general reckoning:<br />
Give audience, and hear what he doth say.</p>

<p><i>God.</i> I perceive here in my majesty,<br />
How that all creatures be to me unkind,<br />
Living without dread in worldly prosperity:<br />
Of ghostly sight the people be so blind,<br />
Drowned in sin, they know me not for their God;<br />
In worldly riches is all their mind,<br />
They fear not my rightwiseness, the sharp rod;<br />
My law that I shewed, when I for them died,<br />
They forget clean, and shedding of my blood red;<br />
I hanged between two, it cannot be denied;<br />
To get them life I suffered to be dead;<br />
I healed their feet, with thorns hurt was my head:<br />
I could do no more than I did truly,<br />
And now I see the people do clean forsake me.<br />
They use the seven deadly sins damnable;<br />
As pride, covetise, wrath, and lechery,<br />
Now in the world be made commendable;<br />
And thus they leave of angels the heavenly company;<br />
Everyman liveth so after his own pleasure,<br />
And yet of their life they be nothing sure:<br />
I see the more that I them forbear<br />
The worse they be from year to year;<br />
All that liveth appaireth<sup><a href="#fn_7" id="fna_7">7</a></sup> fast,<br />
Therefore I will in all the haste<br />
Have a reckoning of Everyman's person<br />
For and I leave the people thus alone<br />
In their life and wicked tempests,<br />
Verily they will become much worse than beasts;<br />
For now one would by envy another up eat;<br />
Charity they all do clean forget.<br />
I hoped well that Everyman<br />
In my glory should make his mansion,<br />
And thereto I had them all elect;<br />
But now I see, like traitors deject,<br />
They thank me not for the pleasure that I to them meant,<br />
Nor yet for their being that I them have lent;<br />
I proffered the people great multitude of mercy,<br />
And few there be that asketh it heartily;<br />
They be so cumbered with worldly riches,<br />
That needs on them I must do justice,<br />
On Everyman living without fear.<br />
Where art thou, <i>Death</i>, thou mighty messenger?</p>

<p><i>Death.</i> Almighty God, I am here at your will,<br />
Your commandment to fulfil.</p>

<p><i>God.</i> Go thou to <i>Everyman</i>,<br />
And show him in my name<br />
A pilgrimage he must on him take,<br />
Which he in no wise may escape;<br />
And that he bring with him a sure reckoning<br />
Without delay or any tarrying.</p>

<p><i>Death.</i> Lord, I will in the world go run over all,<br />
And cruelly outsearch both great and small;<br />
Every man will I beset that liveth beastly<br />
Out of God's laws, and dreadeth not folly:<br />
He that loveth riches I will strike with my dart,<br />
His sight to blind, and from heaven to depart,<br />
Except that alms be his good friend,<br />
In hell for to dwell, world without end.<br />
Lo, yonder I see <i>Everyman</i> walking;<br />
Full little he thinketh on my coming;<br />
His mind is on fleshly lusts and his treasure,<br />
And great pain it shall cause him to endure<br />
Before the Lord Heaven King.<br />
<i>Everyman</i>, stand still; whither art thou going<br />
Thus gaily? Hast thou thy Maker forget?</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Why askst thou?<br />
Wouldest thou wete?<sup><a href="#fn_8" id="fna_8">8</a></sup></p>

<p><i>Death.</i> Yea, sir, I will show you;<br />
In great haste I am sent to thee<br />
From God out of his majesty.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> What, sent to me?</p>

<p><i>Death.</i> Yea, certainly.<br />
Though thou have forget him here,<br />
He thinketh on thee in the heavenly sphere,<br />
As, or we depart, thou shalt know.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> What desireth God of me?</p>

<p><i>Death.</i> That shall I show thee;<br />
A reckoning he will needs have<br />
Without any longer respite.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> To give a reckoning longer leisure I crave;<br />
This blind matter troubleth my wit.</p>

<p><i>Death.</i> On thee thou must take a long journey:<br />
Therefore thy book of count with thee thou bring;<br />
For turn again thou can not by no way,<br />
And look thou be sure of thy reckoning:<br />
For before God thou shalt answer, and show<br />
Thy many bad deeds and good but a few;<br />
How thou hast spent thy life, and in what wise,<br />
Before the chief lord of paradise.<br />
Have ado that we were in that way,<br />
For, wete thou well, thou shalt make none attournay.<sup><a href="#fn_9" id="fna_9">9</a></sup></p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Full unready I am such reckoning to give.<br />
I know thee not: what messenger art thou?</p>

<p><i>Death.</i> I am <i>Death</i>, that no man dreadeth.<br />
For every man I rest and no man spareth;<br />
For it is God's commandment<br />
That all to me should be obedient.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> O <i>Death</i>, thou comest when I had thee least in mind;<br />
In thy power it lieth me to save,<br />
Yet of my good will I give thee, if ye will be kind,<br />
Yea, a thousand pound shalt thou have,<br />
And defer this matter till another day.</p>

<p><i>Death.</i> <i>Everyman</i>, it may not be by no way;<br />
I set not by gold, silver, nor riches,<br />
Ne by pope, emperor, king, duke, ne princes.<br />
For and I would receive gifts great,<br />
All the world I might get;<br />
But my custom is clean contrary.<br />
I give thee no respite: come hence, and not tarry.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Alas, shall I have no longer respite?<br />
I may say <i>Death</i> giveth no warning:<br />
To think on thee, it maketh my heart sick,<br />
For all unready is my book of reckoning.<br />
But twelve year and I might have abiding,<br />
My counting book I would make so clear,<br />
That my reckoning I should not need to fear.<br />
Wherefore, <i>Death</i>, I pray thee, for God's mercy,<br />
Spare me till I be provided of remedy.</p>

<p><i>Death.</i> Thee availeth not to cry, weep, and pray:<br />
But haste thee lightly that you were gone the journey,<br />
And prove thy friends if thou can.<br />
For, wete thou well, the tide abideth no man,<br />
And in the world each living creature<br />
For <i>Adam's</i> sin must die of nature.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> <i>Death</i>, if I should this pilgrimage take,<br />
And my reckoning surely make,<br />
Show me, for saint <i>charity</i>,<br />
Should I not come again shortly?</p>

<p><i>Death.</i> No, <i>Everyman</i>; and thou be once there,<br />
Thou mayst never more come here,<br />
Trust me verily.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> O gracious God, in the high seat celestial,<br />
Have mercy on me in this most need;<br />
Shall I have no company from this vale terrestrial<br />
Of mine acquaintance that way me to lead?</p>

<p><i>Death.</i> Yea, if any be so hardy,<br />
That would go with thee and bear thee company.<br />
Hie thee that you were gone to God's magnificence,<br />
Thy reckoning to give before his presence.<br />
What, weenest thou thy life is given thee,<br />
And thy worldly goods also?</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> I had wend so, verily.</p>

<p><i>Death.</i> Nay, nay; it was but lent thee;<br />
For as soon as thou art go,<br />
Another awhile shall have it, and then go therefro<br />
Even as thou hast done.<br />
<i>Everyman</i>, thou art mad; thou hast thy wits five,<br />
And here on earth will not amend thy life,<br />
For suddenly I do come.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> O wretched caitiff, whither shall I flee,<br />
That I might scape this endless sorrow!<br />
Now, gentle <i>Death</i>, spare me till to-morrow,<br />
That I may amend me<br />
With good advisement.</p>

<p><i>Death.</i> Nay, thereto I will not consent,<br />
Nor no man will I respite,<br />
But to the heart suddenly I shall smite<br />
Without any advisement.<br />
And now out of thy sight I will me hie;<br />
See thou make thee ready shortly,<br />
For thou mayst say this is the day<br />
That no man living may scape away.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Alas, I may well weep with sighs deep;<br />
Now have I no manner of company<br />
To help me in my journey, and me to keep;<br />
And also my writing is full unready.<br />
How shall I do now for to excuse me?<br />
I would to God I had never be gete!<sup><a href="#fn_10" id="fna_10">10</a></sup><br />
To my soul a full great profit it had be;<br />
For now I fear pains huge and great.<br />
The time passeth; Lord, help that all wrought;<br />
For though I mourn it availeth nought.<br />
The day passeth, and is almost a-go;<br />
I wot not well what for to do.<br />
To whom were I best my complaint to make?<br />
What, and I to <i>Fellowship</i> thereof spake,<br />
And showed him of this sudden chance?<br />
For in him is all mine affiance;<br />
We have in the world so many a day<br />
Be on good friends in sport and play.<br />
I see him yonder, certainly;<br />
I trust that he will bear me company;<br />
Therefore to him will I speak to ease my sorrow.<br />
Well met, good <i>Fellowship</i>, and good morrow!</p>

<p><i>Fellowship speaketh.</i> <i>Everyman</i>, good morrow by this day.<br />
Sir, why lookest thou so piteously?<br />
If any thing be amiss, I pray thee, me say,<br />
That I may help to remedy.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Yea, good <i>Fellowship</i>, yea,<br />
I am in great jeopardy.</p>

<p><i>Fellowship.</i> My true friend, show to me your mind;<br />
I will not forsake thee, unto my life's end,<br />
In the way of good company.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> That was well spoken, and lovingly.</p>

<p><i>Fellowship.</i> Sir, I must needs know your heaviness;<br />
I have pity to see you in any distress;<br />
If any have you wronged ye shall revenged be,<br />
Though I on the ground be slain for thee,--<br />
Though that I know before that I should die.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Verily, <i>Fellowship</i>, gramercy.</p>

<p><i>Fellowship.</i> Tush! by thy thanks I set not a straw.<br />
Show me your grief, and say no more.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> If I my heart should to you break,<br />
And then you to turn your mind from me,<br />
And would not me comfort, when you hear me speak,<br />
Then should I ten times sorrier be.</p>

<p><i>Fellowship.</i> Sir, I say as I will do in deed.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Then be you a good friend at need:<br />
I have found you true here before.</p>

<p><i>Fellowship.</i> And so ye shall evermore;<br />
For, in faith, and thou go to Hell,<br />
I will not forsake thee by the way!</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Ye speak like a good friend; I believe you well;<br />
I shall deserve it, and I may.</p>

<p><i>Fellowship.</i> I speak of no deserving, by this day.<br />
For he that will say and nothing do<br />
Is not worthy with good company to go;<br />
Therefore show me the grief of your mind,<br />
As to your friend most loving and kind.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> I shall show you how it is;<br />
Commanded I am to go a journey,<br />
A long way, hard and dangerous,<br />
And give a strait count without delay<br />
Before the high judge Adonai.<sup><a href="#fn_11" id="fna_11">11</a></sup><br />
Wherefore I pray you, bear me company,<br />
As ye have promised, in this journey.</p>

<p><i>Fellowship.</i> That is matter indeed! Promise is duty,<br />
But, and I should take such a voyage on me,<br />
I know it well, it should be to my pain:<br />
Also it make me afeard, certain.<br />
But let us take counsel here as well as we can,<br />
For your words would fear a strong man.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Why, ye said, If I had need,<br />
Ye would me never forsake, quick nor dead,<br />
Though it were to hell truly.</p>

<p><i>Fellowship.</i> So I said, certainly,<br />
But such pleasures be set aside, thee sooth to say:<br />
And also, if we took such a journey,<br />
When should we come again?</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Nay, never again till the day of doom.</p>

<p><i>Fellowship.</i> In faith, then will not I come there!<br />
Who hath you these tidings brought?</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Indeed, <i>Death</i> was with me here.</p>

<p><i>Fellowship.</i> Now, by God that all hath bought,<br />
If <i>Death</i> were the messenger,<br />
For no man that is living to-day<br />
I will not go that loath journey--<br />
Not for the father that begat me!</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Ye promised other wise, pardie.</p>

<p><i>Fellowship.</i> I wot well I say so truly;<br />
And yet if thou wilt eat, and drink, and make good cheer,<br />
Or haunt to women, the lusty company,<br />
I would not forsake you, while the day is clear,<br />
Trust me verily!</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Yea, thereto ye would be ready;<br />
To go to mirth, solace, and play,<br />
Your mind will sooner apply<br />
Than to bear me company in my long journey.</p>

<p><i>Fellowship.</i> Now, in good faith, I will not that way.<br />
But and thou wilt murder, or any man kill,<br />
In that I will help thee with a good will!</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> O that is a simple advice indeed!<br />
Gentle <i>fellow</i>, help me in my necessity;<br />
We have loved long, and now I need,<br />
And now, gentle <i>Fellowship</i>, remember me.</p>

<p><i>Fellowship.</i> Whether ye have loved me or no,<br />
By Saint John, I will not with thee go.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Yet I pray thee, take the labour, and do so much for me<br />
To bring me forward, for saint charity,<br />
And comfort me till I come without the town.</p>

<p><i>Fellowship.</i> Nay, and thou would give me a new gown,<br />
I will not a foot with thee go;<br />
But and you had tarried I would not have left thee so.<br />
And as now, God speed thee in thy journey,<br />
For from thee I will depart as fast as I may.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Whither away, <i>Fellowship</i>? will you forsake me?</p>

<p><i>Fellowship.</i> Yea, by my fay, to God I betake thee.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Farewell, good <i>Fellowship</i>; for this my heart is sore;<br />
Adieu for ever, I shall see thee no more.</p>

<p><i>Fellowship.</i> In faith, <i>Everyman</i>, farewell now at the end;<br />
For you I will remember that parting is mourning.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Alack! shall we thus depart indeed?<br />
Our Lady, help, without any more comfort,<br />
Lo, <i>Fellowship</i> forsaketh me in my most need:<br />
For help in this world whither shall I resort?<br />
<i>Fellowship</i> herebefore with me would merry make;<br />
And now little sorrow for me doth he take.<br />
It is said, in prosperity men friends may find,<br />
Which in adversity be full unkind.<br />
Now whither for succour shall I flee,<br />
Sith that <i>Fellowship</i> hath forsaken me?<br />
To my kinsmen I will truly,<br />
Praying them to help me in my necessity;<br />
I believe that they will do so,<br />
For kind will creep where it may not go.<br />
I will go say, for yonder I see them go.<br />
Where be ye now, my friends and kinsmen?</p>

<p><i>Kindred.</i> Here be we now at your commandment.<br />
<i>Cousin</i>, I pray you show us your intent<br />
In any wise, and not spare.</p>

<p><i>Cousin.</i> Yea, <i>Everyman</i>, and to us declare<br />
If ye be disposed to go any whither,<br />
For wete you well, we will live and die together.</p>

<p><i>Kindred.</i> In wealth and woe we will with you hold,<br />
For over his kin a man may be bold.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Gramercy, my friends and kinsmen kind.<br />
Now shall I show you the grief of my mind:<br />
I was commanded by a messenger,<br />
That is an high king's chief officer;<br />
He bade me go a pilgrimage to my pain,<br />
And I know well I shall never come again;<br />
Also I must give a reckoning straight,<br />
For I have a great enemy, that hath me in wait,<br />
Which intendeth me for to hinder.</p>

<p><i>Kindred.</i> What account is that which ye must render?<br />
That would I know.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Of all my works I must show<br />
How I have lived and my days spent;<br />
Also of ill deeds, that I have used<br />
In my time, sith life was me lent;<br />
And of all virtues that I have refused.<br />
Therefore I pray you go thither with me,<br />
To help to make mine account, for saint <i>charity</i>.</p>

<p><i>Cousin.</i> What, to go thither? Is that the matter?<br />
Nay, <i>Everyman</i>, I had liefer fast bread and water<br />
All this five year and more.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Alas, that ever I was bore!<sup><a href="#fn_12" id="fna_12">12</a></sup><br />
For now shall I never be merry<br />
If that you forsake me.</p>

<p><i>Kindred.</i> Ah, sir; what, ye be a merry man!<br />
Take good heart to you, and make no moan.<br />
But one thing I warn you, by Saint Anne,<br />
As for me, ye shall go alone.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> My <i>Cousin</i>, will you not with me go?</p>

<p><i>Cousin.</i> No, by our Lady; I have the cramp in my toe.<br />
Trust not to me, for, so God me speed,<br />
I will deceive you in your most need,<br />
<i>Kindred.</i> It availeth not us to tice.<br />
Ye shall have my maid with all my heart;<br />
She loveth to go to feasts, there to be nice,<br />
And to dance, and abroad to start:<br />
I will give her leave to help you in that journey,<br />
If that you and she may agree.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Now show me the very effect of your mind.<br />
Will you go with me, or abide behind?</p>

<p><i>Kindred.</i> Abide behind? yea, that I will and I may!<br />
Therefore farewell until another day.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> How should I be merry or glad?<br />
For fair promises to me make,<br />
But when I have most need, they me forsake.<br />
I am deceived; that maketh me sad.</p>

<p><i>Cousin.</i> Cousin <i>Everyman</i>, farewell now,<br />
For verily I will not go with you;<br />
Also of mine own an unready reckoning<br />
I have to account; therefore I make tarrying.<br />
Now, God keep thee, for now I go.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Ah, <i>Jesus</i>, is all come hereto?<br />
Lo, fair words maketh fools feign;<br />
They promise and nothing will do certain.<br />
My kinsmen promised me faithfully<br />
For to abide with me steadfastly,<br />
And now fast away do they flee:<br />
Even so <i>Fellowship</i> promised me.<br />
What friend were best me of to provide?<br />
I lose my time here longer to abide.<br />
Yet in my mind a thing there is;--<br />
All my life I have loved riches;<br />
If that my good now help me might,<br />
He would make my heart full light.<br />
I will speak to him in this distress.--<br />
Where art thou, my <i>Goods</i> and riches?</p>

<p><i>Goods.</i> Who calleth me? <i>Everyman?</i> what haste thou hast!<br />
I lie here in corners, trussed and piled so high,<br />
And in chests I am locked so fast,<br />
Also sacked in bags, thou mayst see with thine eye,<br />
I cannot stir; in packs low I lie.<br />
What would ye have, lightly me say.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Come hither, <i>Good</i>, in all the haste thou may,<br />
For of counsel I must desire thee.</p>

<p><i>Goods.</i> Sir, and ye in the world have trouble or adversity,<br />
That can I help you to remedy shortly.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> It is another disease that grieveth me;<br />
In this world it is not, I tell thee so.<br />
I am sent for another way to go,<br />
To give a straight account general<br />
Before the highest <i>Jupiter</i> of all;<br />
And all my life I have had joy and pleasure in thee.<br />
Therefore I pray thee go with me,<br />
For, peradventure, thou mayst before God Almighty<br />
My reckoning help to clean and purify;<br />
For it is said ever among,<br />
That money maketh all right that is wrong.</p>

<p><i>Goods.</i> Nay, <i>Everyman</i>, I sing another song,<br />
I follow no man in such voyages;<br />
For and I went with thee<br />
Thou shouldst fare much the worse for me;<br />
For because on me thou did set thy mind,<br />
Thy reckoning I have made blotted and blind,<br />
That thine account thou cannot make truly;<br />
And that hast thou for the love of me.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> That would grieve me full sore,<br />
When I should come to that fearful answer.<br />
Up, let us go thither together.</p>

<p><i>Goods.</i> Nay, not so, I am too brittle, I may not endure;<br />
I will follow no man one foot, be ye sure.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Alas, I have thee loved, and had great pleasure<br />
All my life-days on good and treasure.</p>

<p><i>Goods.</i> That is to thy damnation without lesing,<br />
For my love is contrary to the love everlasting.<br />
But if thou had me loved moderately during,<br />
As, to the poor give part of me,<br />
Then shouldst thou not in this dolour be,<br />
Nor in this great sorrow and care.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Lo, now was I deceived or I was ware,<br />
And all I may wyte<sup><a href="#fn_13" id="fna_13">13</a></sup> my spending of time.</p>

<p><i>Goods.</i> What, weenest thou that I am thine?</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> I had wend so.</p>

<p><i>Goods.</i> Nay, <i>Everyman,</i> I say no;<br />
As for a while I was lent thee,<br />
A season thou hast had me in prosperity;<br />
My condition is man's soul to kill;<br />
If I save one, a thousand I do spill;<br />
Weenest thou that I will follow thee?<br />
Nay, from this world, not verily.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> I had wend otherwise.</p>

<p><i>Goods.</i> Therefore to thy soul <i>Good</i> is a thief;<br />
For when thou art dead, this is my guise<br />
Another to deceive in the same wise<br />
As I have done thee, and all to his soul's reprief.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> O false <i>Good</i>, cursed thou be!<br />
Thou traitor to God, that hast deceived me,<br />
And caught me in thy snare.</p>

<p><i>Goods.</i> Marry, thou brought thyself in care,<br />
Whereof I am glad,<br />
I must needs laugh, I cannot be sad.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Ah, <i>Good</i>, thou hast had long my heartly love;<br />
I gave thee that which should be the Lord's above.<br />
But wilt thou not go with me in deed?<br />
I pray thee truth to say.</p>

<p><i>Goods.</i> No, so God me speed,<br />
Therefore farewell, and have good day.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> O, to whom shall I make my moan<br />
For to go with me in that heavy journey?<br />
First <i>Fellowship</i> said he would with me gone;<br />
His words were very pleasant and gay,<br />
But afterward he left me alone.<br />
Then spake I to my kinsmen all in despair,<br />
And also they gave me words fair,<br />
They lacked no fair speaking,<br />
But all forsake me in the ending.<br />
Then went I to my <i>Goods</i> that I loved best,<br />
In hope to have comfort, but there had I least;<br />
For my <i>Goods</i> sharply did me tell<br />
That he bringeth many into hell.<br />
Then of myself I was ashamed,<br />
And so I am worthy to be blamed;<br />
Thus may I well myself hate.<br />
Of whom shall I now counsel take?<br />
I think that I shall never speed<br />
Till that I go to my <i>Good-Deed</i>,<br />
But alas, she is so weak,<br />
That she can neither go nor speak;<br />
Yet will I venture on her now.--<br />
My <i>Good-Deeds</i>, where be you?</p>

<p><i>Good-Deeds.</i> Here I lie cold in the ground;<br />
Thy sins hath me sore bound,<br />
That I cannot stir.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> O, <i>Good-Deeds</i>, I stand in fear;<br />
I must you pray of counsel,<br />
For help now should come right well.</p>

<p><i>Goods-Deeds.</i> <i>Everyman</i>, I have understanding<br />
That ye be summoned account to make<br />
Before <i>Messias</i>, of Jerusalem King;<br />
And you do by me<sup><a href="#fn_14" id="fna_14">14</a></sup> that journey what<sup><a href="#fn_15" id="fna_15">15</a></sup> you will I take.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Therefore I come to you, my moan to make;<br />
I pray you, that ye will go with me.</p>

<p><i>Good-Deeds.</i> I would full fain, but I cannot stand verily.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Why, is there anything on you fall?</p>

<p><i>Good-Deeds.</i> Yea, sir, I may thank you of all;<br />
If ye had perfectly cheered me,<br />
Your book of account now full ready had be.<br />
Look, the books of your works and deeds eke;<br />
Oh, see how they lie under the feet,<br />
To your soul's heaviness.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Our Lord <i>Jesus</i>, help me!<br />
For one letter here I can not see.</p>

<p><i>Good-Deeds.</i> There is a blind reckoning in time of distress!</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> <i>Good-Deeds</i>, I pray you, help me in this need,<br />
Or else I am for ever damned indeed;<br />
Therefore help me to make reckoning<br />
Before the redeemer of all thing,<br />
That king is, and was, and ever shall.</p>

<p><i>Good-Deeds.</i> <i>Everyman</i>, I am sorry of your fall,<br />
And fain would I help you, and I were able.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> <i>Good-Deeds</i>, your counsel I pray you give me.</p>

<p><i>Good-Deeds.</i> That shall I do verily;<br />
Though that on my feet I may not go,<br />
I have a sister, that shall with you also,<br />
Called <i>Knowledge</i>, which shall with you abide,<br />
To help you to make that dreadful reckoning.</p>

<p><i>Knowledge.</i> <i>Everyman</i>, I will go with thee, and be thy guide,<br />
In thy most need to go by thy side.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> In good condition I am now in every thing,<br />
And am wholly content with this good thing;<br />
Thanked be God my Creator.</p>

<p><i>Good-Deeds.</i> And when he hath brought thee there,<br />
Where thou shalt heal thee of thy smart,<br />
Then go you with your reckoning and your <i>Good-Deeds</i> together<br />
For to make you joyful at heart<br />
Before the blessed Trinity.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> My <i>Good-Deeds</i>, gramercy;<br />
I am well content, certainly,<br />
With your words sweet.</p>

<p><i>Knowledge.</i> Now go we together lovingly,<br />
To <i>Confession</i>, that cleansing river.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> For joy I weep; I would we were there;<br />
But, I pray you, give me cognition<br />
Where dwelleth that holy man, <i>Confession</i>.</p>

<p><i>Knowledge.</i> In the house of salvation:<br />
We shall find him in that place,<br />
That shall us comfort by God's grace.<br />
Lo, this is <i>Confession</i>; kneel down and ask mercy,<br />
For he is in good conceit with God almighty.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> O glorious fountain that all uncleanness doth clarify,<br />
Wash from me the spots of vices unclean,<br />
That on me no sin may be seen;<br />
I come with <i>Knowledge</i> for my redemption,<br />
Repent with hearty and full contrition;<br />
For I am commanded a pilgrimage to take,<br />
And great accounts before God to make.<br />
Now, I pray you, <i>Shrift</i>, mother of salvation,<br />
Help my good deeds for my piteous exclamation.</p>

<p><i>Confession.</i> I know your sorrow well, <i>Everyman</i>;<br />
Because with <i>Knowledge</i> ye come to me,<br />
I will you comfort as well as I can,<br />
And a precious jewel I will give thee,<br />
Called penance, wise voider of adversity;<br />
Therewith shall your body chastised be,<br />
With abstinence and perseverance in God's service:<br />
Here shall you receive that scourge of me,<br />
Which is penance strong, that ye must endure,<br />
To remember thy Saviour was scourged for thee<br />
With sharp scourges, and suffered it patiently;<br />
So must thou, or thou scape that painful pilgrimage;<br />
<i>Knowledge</i>, keep him in this voyage,<br />
And by that time <i>Good-Deeds</i> will be with thee.<br />
But in any wise, be sure of mercy,<br />
For your time draweth fast, and ye will saved be;<br />
Ask God mercy, and He will grant truly,<br />
When with the scourge of penance man doth him bind,<br />
The oil of forgiveness then shall he find.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Thanked be God for his gracious work!<br />
For now I will my penance begin;<br />
This hath rejoiced and lighted my heart,<br />
Though the knots be painful and hard within.</p>

<p><i>Knowledge.</i> <i>Everyman</i>, look your penance that ye fulfil,<br />
What pain that ever it to you be,<br />
And <i>Knowledge</i> shall give you counsel at will,<br />
How your accounts ye shall make clearly.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> O eternal God, O heavenly figure,<br />
O way of rightwiseness, O goodly vision,<br />
Which descended down in a virgin pure<br />
Because he would <i>Everyman</i> redeem,<br />
Which <i>Adam</i> forfeited by his disobedience:<br />
O blessed Godhead, elect and high-divine,<br />
Forgive my grievous offence;<br />
Here I cry thee mercy in this presence.<br />
O ghostly treasure, O ransomer and redeemer<br />
Of all the world, hope and conductor,<br />
Mirror of joy, and founder of mercy,<br />
Which illumineth heaven and earth thereby,<br />
Hear my clamorous complaint, though it late be;<br />
Receive my prayers; unworthy in this heavy life,<br />
Though I be, a sinner most abominable,<br />
Yet let my name be written in <i>Moses'</i> table;<br />
O <i>Mary</i>, pray to the Maker of all thing,<br />
Me for to help at my ending,<br />
And save me from the power of my enemy,<br />
For <i>Death</i> assaileth me strongly;<br />
And, Lady, that I may by means of thy prayer<br />
Of your Son's glory to be partaker,<br />
By the means of his passion I it crave,<br />
I beseech you, help my soul to save.--<br />
<i>Knowledge</i>, give me the scourge of penance;<br />
My flesh therewith shall give a quittance:<br />
I will now begin, if God give me grace.</p>

<p><i>Knowledge.</i> <i>Everyman</i>, God give you time and space:<br />
Thus I bequeath you in the hands of our Saviour,<br />
Thus may you make your reckoning sure.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> In the name of the Holy Trinity,<br />
My body sore punished shall be:<br />
Take this body for the sin of the flesh;<br />
Also thou delightest to go gay and fresh,<br />
And in the way of damnation thou did me bring;<br />
Therefore suffer now strokes and punishing.<br />
Now of penance I will wade the water clear,<br />
To save me from purgatory, that sharp fire.</p>

<p><i>Good-Deeds.</i> I thank God, now I can walk and go;<br />
And am delivered of my sickness and woe.<br />
Therefore with <i>Everyman</i> I will go, and not spare;<br />
His good works I will help him to declare.</p>

<p><i>Knowledge.</i> Now, <i>Everyman</i>, be merry and glad;<br />
Your <i>Good-Deeds</i> cometh now; ye may not be sad;<br />
Now is your <i>Good-Deeds</i> whole and sound,<br />
Going upright upon the ground.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> My heart is light, and shall be evermore;<br />
Now will I smite faster than I did before.</p>

<p><i>Good-Deeds.</i> <i>Everyman</i>, pilgrim, my special friend,<br />
Blessed be thou without end;<br />
For thee is prepared the eternal glory.<br />
Ye have me made whole and sound,<br />
Therefore I will bide by thee in every stound.<sup><a href="#fn_16" id="fna_16">16</a></sup></p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Welcome, my <i>Good-Deeds</i>; now I hear thy voice,<br />
I weep for very sweetness of love.</p>

<p><i>Knowledge.</i> Be no more sad, but ever rejoice,<br />
God seeth thy living in his throne above;<br />
Put on this garment to thy behove,<br />
Which is wet with your tears,<br />
Or else before God you may it miss,<br />
When you to your journey's end come shall.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Gentle <i>Knowledge</i>, what do you it call?</p>

<p><i>Knowledge.</i> It is a garment of sorrow:<br />
From pain it will you borrow;<br />
Contrition it is,<br />
That getteth forgiveness;<br />
It pleaseth God passing well.</p>

<p><i>Good-Deeds.</i> <i>Everyman</i>, will you wear it for your heal?</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Now blessed be <i>Jesu, Mary's</i> Son!<br />
For now have I on true contrition.<br />
And let us go now without tarrying;<br />
<i>Good-Deeds</i>, have we clear our reckoning?</p>

<p><i>Good-Deeds.</i> Yea, indeed I have it here.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Then I trust we need not fear;<br />
Now, friends, let us not part in twain.</p>

<p><i>Knowledge.</i> Nay, <i>Everyman</i>, that will we not, certain.</p>

<p><i>Good-Deeds.</i> Yet must thou lead with thee<br />
Three persons of great might.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Who should they be?</p>

<p><i>Good-Deeds.</i> <i>Discretion</i> and <i>Strength</i> they hight,<br />
And thy <i>Beauty</i> may not abide behind.</p>

<p><i>Knowledge.</i> Also ye must call to mind<br />
Your <i>Five-wits</i> as for your counsellors.</p>

<p><i>Good-Deeds.</i> You must have them ready at all hours.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> How shall I get them hither?</p>

<p><i>Knowledge.</i> You must call them all together,<br />
And they will hear you incontinent.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> My friends, come hither and be present<br />
<i>Discretion</i>, <i>Strength</i>, my <i>Five-wits</i>, and <i>Beauty</i>.</p>

<p><i>Beauty.</i> Here at your will we be all ready.<br />
What will ye that we should do?</p>

<p><i>Good-Deeds.</i> That ye would with <i>Everyman</i> go,<br />
And help him in his pilgrimage,<br />
Advise you, will ye with him or not in that voyage?</p>

<p><i>Strength.</i> We will bring him all thither,<br />
To his help and comfort, ye may believe me.</p>

<p><i>Discretion.</i> So will we go with him all together.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Almighty God, loved thou be,<br />
I give thee laud that I have hither brought<br />
<i>Strength</i>, <i>Discretion</i>, <i>Beauty</i>, and <i>Five-wits</i>; lack I nought;<br />
And my <i>Good-Deeds</i>, with <i>Knowledge</i> clear,<br />
All be in my company at my will here;<br />
I desire no more to my business.</p>

<p><i>Strength.</i> And I, <i>Strength</i>, will by you stand in distress,<br />
Though thou would in battle fight on the ground.</p>

<p><i>Five-wits.</i> And though it were through the world round,<br />
We will not depart for sweet nor sour.</p>

<p><i>Beauty.</i> No more will I unto death's hour,<br />
Whatsoever thereof befall.</p>

<p><i>Discretion.</i> <i>Everyman</i>, advise you first of all;<br />
Go with a good advisement and deliberation;<br />
We all give you virtuous monition<br />
That all shall be well.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> My friends, hearken what I will tell:<br />
I pray God reward you in his heavenly sphere.<br />
Now hearken, all that be here,<br />
For I will make my testament<br />
Here before you all present.<br />
In alms half my good I will give with my hands twain<br />
In the way of charity, with good intent,<br />
And the other half still shall remain<br />
In quiet to be returned there it ought to be.<br />
This I do in despite of the fiend of hell<br />
To go quite out of his peril<br />
Ever after and this day.</p>

<p><i>Knowledge.</i> <i>Everyman</i>, hearken what I say;<br />
Go to priesthood, I you advise,<br />
And receive of him in any wise<br />
The holy sacrament and ointment together;<br />
Then shortly see ye turn again hither;<br />
We will all abide you here.</p>

<p><i>Five-Wits.</i> Yea, <i>Everyman</i>, hie you that ye ready were,<br />
There is no emperor, king, duke, ne baron,<br />
That of God hath commission,<br />
As hath the least priest in the world being;<br />
For of the blessed sacraments pure and benign,<br />
He beareth the keys and thereof hath the cure<br />
For man's redemption, it is ever sure;<br />
Which God for our soul's medicine<br />
Gave us out of his heart with great pine;<br />
Here in this transitory life, for thee and me<br />
The blessed sacraments seven there be,<br />
Baptism, confirmation, with priesthood good,<br />
And the sacrament of God's precious flesh and blood,<br />
Marriage, the holy extreme unction, and penance;<br />
These seven be good to have in remembrance,<br />
Gracious sacraments of high divinity.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Fain would I receive that holy body<br />
And meekly to my ghostly father I will go.</p>

<p><i>Five-wits.</i> <i>Everyman</i>, that is the best that ye can do:<br />
God will you to salvation bring,<br />
For priesthood exceedeth all other thing;<br />
To us Holy Scripture they do teach,<br />
And converteth man from sin heaven to reach;<br />
God hath to them more power given,<br />
Than to any angel that is in heaven;<br />
With five words he may consecrate<br />
God's body in flesh and blood to make,<br />
And handleth his maker between his hands;<br />
The priest bindeth and unbindeth all bands,<br />
Both in earth and in heaven;<br />
Thou ministers all the sacraments seven;<br />
Though we kissed thy feet thou were worthy;<br />
Thou art surgeon that cureth sin deadly:<br />
No remedy we find under God<br />
But all only priesthood.<br />
<i>Everyman</i>, God gave priests that dignity,<br />
And setteth them in his stead among us to be;<br />
Thus be they above angels in degree.</p>

<p><i>Knowledge.</i> If priests be good it is so surely;<br />
But when Jesus hanged on the cross with great smart<br />
There he gave, out of his blessed heart,<br />
The same sacrament in great torment:<br />
He sold them not to us, that Lord Omnipotent.<br />
Therefore Saint Peter the apostle doth say<br />
That Jesu's curse hath all they<br />
Which God their Saviour do buy or sell,<br />
Or they for any money do take or tell.<br />
Sinful priests giveth the sinners example bad;<br />
Their children sitteth by other men's fires, I have heard;<br />
And some haunteth women's company,<br />
With unclean life, as lusts of lechery<br />
These be with sin made blind.</p>

<p><i>Five-wits.</i> I trust to God no such may we find;<br />
Therefore let us priesthood honour,<br />
And follow their doctrine for our souls' succour;<br />
We be their sheep, and they shepherds be<br />
By whom we all be kept in surety.<br />
Peace, for yonder I see <i>Everyman</i> come,<br />
Which hath made true satisfaction.</p>

<p><i>Good-Deeds.</i> Methinketh it is he indeed.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Now Jesu be our alder speed.<sup><a href="#fn_17" id="fna_17">17</a></sup><br />
I have received the sacrament for my redemption,<br />
And then mine extreme unction:<br />
Blessed be all they that counselled me to take it!<br />
And now, friends, let us go without longer respite;<br />
I thank God that ye have tarried so long.<br />
Now set each of you on this rod your hand,<br />
And shortly follow me:<br />
I go before, there I would be; God be our guide.</p>

<p><i>Strength.</i> <i>Everyman</i>, we will not from you go,<br />
Till ye have gone this voyage long.</p>

<p><i>Discretion.</i> I, <i>Discretion</i>, will bide by you also.</p>

<p><i>Knowledge.</i> And though this pilgrimage be never so strong,<br />
I will never part you fro:<br />
<i>Everyman</i>, I will be as sure by thee<br />
As ever I did by Judas Maccabee.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Alas, I am so faint I may not stand,<br />
My limbs under me do fold;<br />
Friends, let us not turn again to this land,<br />
Not for all the world's gold,<br />
For into this cave must I creep<br />
And turn to the earth and there to sleep.</p>

<p><i>Beauty.</i> What, into this grave? alas!</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Yea, there shall you consume more and less.</p>

<p><i>Beauty.</i> And what, should I smother here?</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Yea, by my faith, and never more appear.<br />
In this world live no more we shall,<br />
But in heaven before the highest Lord of all.</p>

<p><i>Beauty.</i> I cross out all this; adieu by Saint <i>John</i>;<br />
I take my cap in my lap and am gone.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> What, <i>Beauty</i>, whither will ye?</p>

<p><i>Beauty.</i> Peace, I am deaf; I look not behind me,<br />
Not and thou would give me all the gold in thy chest.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Alas, whereto may I trust?<br />
<i>Beauty</i> goeth fast away hie;<br />
She promised with me to live and die.</p>

<p><i>Strength.</i> <i>Everyman</i>, I will thee also forsake and deny;<br />
Thy game liketh me not at all.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Why, then ye will forsake me all.<br />
Sweet <i>Strength</i>, tarry a little space.</p>

<p><i>Strength.</i> Nay, sir, by the rood of grace<br />
I will hie me from thee fast,<br />
Though thou weep till thy heart brast.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Ye would ever bide by me, ye said.</p>

<p><i>Strength.</i> Yea, I have you far enough conveyed;<br />
Ye be old enough, I understand,<br />
Your pilgrimage to take on hand;<br />
I repent me that I hither came.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> <i>Strength</i>, you to displease I am to blame;<br />
Will you break promise that is debt?</p>

<p><i>Strength.</i> In faith, I care not;<br />
Thou art but a fool to complain,<br />
You spend your speech and waste your brain;<br />
Go thrust thee into the ground.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> I had wend surer I should you have found.<br />
He that trusteth in his <i>Strength</i><br />
She him deceiveth at the length.<br />
Both <i>Strength</i> and <i>Beauty</i> forsaketh me,<br />
Yet they promised me fair and lovingly.</p>

<p><i>Discretion. Everyman</i>, I will after <i>Strength</i> be gone,<br />
As for me I will leave you alone.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Why, <i>Discretion</i>, will ye forsake me?</p>

<p><i>Discretion.</i> Yea, in faith, I will go from thee,<br />
For when <i>Strength</i> goeth before<br />
I follow after evermore.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Yet, I pray thee, for the love of the Trinity,<br />
Look in my grave once piteously.</p>

<p><i>Discretion.</i> Nay, so nigh will I not come.<br />
Farewell, every one!</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> O all thing faileth, save God alone;<br />
<i>Beauty</i>, <i>Strength</i>, and <i>Discretion</i>;<br />
For when <i>Death</i> bloweth his blast,<br />
They all run from me full fast.</p>

<p><i>Five-wits. Everyman</i>, my leave now of thee I take;<br />
I will follow the other, for here I thee forsake.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Alas! then may I wail and weep,<br />
For I took you for my best friend.</p>

<p><i>Five-wits.</i> I will no longer thee keep;<br />
Now farewell, and there an end.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> O Jesu, help, all hath forsaken me!</p>

<p><i>Good-Deeds.</i> Nay, <i>Everyman</i>, I will bide with thee,<br />
I will not forsake thee indeed;<br />
Thou shalt find me a good friend at need.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Gramercy, <i>Good-Deeds</i>; now may I true friends see;<br />
They have forsaken me every one;<br />
I loved them better than my <i>Good-Deeds</i> alone.<br />
<i>Knowledge</i>, will ye forsake me also?</p>

<p><i>Knowledge.</i> Yea, <i>Everyman</i>, when ye to death do go:<br />
But not yet for no manner of danger.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Gramercy, <i>Knowledge</i>, with all my heart.</p>

<p><i>Knowledge.</i> Nay, yet I will not from hence depart,<br />
Till I see where ye shall be come.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Methinketh, alas, that I must be gone,<br />
To make my reckoning and my debts pay,<br />
For I see my time is nigh spent away.<br />
Take example, all ye that this do hear or see,<br />
How they that I loved best do forsake me,<br />
Except my <i>Good-Deeds</i> that bideth truly.</p>

<p><i>Good-Deeds.</i> All earthly things is but vanity:<br />
<i>Beauty</i>, <i>Strength</i>, and <i>Discretion</i>, do man forsake,<br />
Foolish friends and kinsmen, that fair spake,<br />
All fleeth save <i>Good-Deeds</i>, and that am I.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Have mercy on me, God most mighty;<br />
And stand by me, thou Mother and Maid, holy <i>Mary</i>.</p>

<p><i>Good-Deeds.</i> Fear not, I will speak for thee.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Here I cry God mercy.</p>

<p><i>Good-Deeds.</i> Short our end, and minish our pain;<br />
Let us go and never come again.</p>

<p><i>Everyman.</i> Into thy hands, Lord, my soul I commend;<br />
Receive it, Lord, that it be not lost;<br />
As thou me boughtest, so me defend,<br />
And save me from the fiend's boast,<br />
That I may appear with that blessed host<br />
That shall be saved at the day of doom.<br />
<i>In manus tuas</i>--of might's most<br />
For ever--<i>commendo spiritum meum</i>.</p>

<p><i>Knowledge.</i> Now hath he suffered that we all shall endure;<br />
The <i>Good-Deeds</i> shall make all sure.<br />
Now hath he made ending;<br />
Methinketh that I hear angels sing<br />
And make great joy and melody,<br />
Where <i>Everyman's</i> soul received shall be.</p>

<p><i>Angel.</i> Come, excellent elect spouse to Jesu:<br />
Hereabove thou shalt go<br />
Because of thy singular virtue:<br />
Now the soul is taken the body fro;<br />
Thy reckoning is crystal-clear.<br />
Now shalt thou into the heavenly sphere,<br />
Unto the which all ye shall come<br />
That liveth well before the day of doom.</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> This moral men may have in mind;<br />
Ye hearers, take it of worth, old and young,<br />
And forsake pride, for he deceiveth you in the end,<br />
And remember <i>Beauty</i>, <i>Five-wits</i>, <i>Strength</i>, and <i>Discretion</i>,<br />
They all at the last do <i>Everyman</i> forsake,<br />
Save his <i>Good-Deeds</i>, there doth he take.<br />
But beware, and they be small<br />
Before God, he hath no help at all.<br />
None excuse may be there for <i>Everyman</i>:<br />
Alas, how shall he do then?<br />
For after death amends may no man make,<br />
For then mercy and pity do him forsake.<br />
If his reckoning be not clear when he do come,<br />
God will say--<i>ite maledicti in ignem &aelig;ternum</i>.<br />
And he that hath his account whole and sound,<br />
High in heaven he shall be crowned;<br />
Unto which place God bring us all thither<br />
That we may live body and soul together.<br />
Thereto help the Trinity,<br />
Amen, say ye, for saint <i>Charity</i>.</p>

<h3>THE CHESTER PAGEANT OF THE DELUGE</h3>



<p><i>God.</i> I, God, that all the world have wrought<br />
Heaven and Earth, and all of nought,<br />
I see my people, in deed and thought,<br />
Are foully set in sin.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;My ghost shall not lodge in any man<br />
That through fleshly liking is my fone,<sup><a href="#fn_18" id="fna_18">18</a></sup><br />
But till six score years be gone<br />
To look if they will blynne.<sup><a href="#fn_19" id="fna_19">19</a></sup><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Man that I made I will destroy,<br />
Beast, worm, and fowl to fly,<br />
For on earth they me annoy,<br />
The folk that is thereon.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For it harms me so hurtfully<br />
The malice now that can multiply,<br />
That sore it grieveth me inwardly,<br />
That ever I made man.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore Noah, my servant free,<br />
That righteous man art, as I see,<br />
A ship soon thou shalt make thee,<br />
Of trees dry and light.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Little chambers therein thou make<br />
And binding slich<sup><a href="#fn_20" id="fna_20">20</a></sup> also thou take<br />
Within and out, thou not slake<br />
To annoint it through all thy might.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hundred cubits it shall be long,<br />
And so of breadth to make it strong,<br />
Of height so, then must thou fonge,<sup><a href="#fn_21" id="fna_21">21</a></sup><br />
Thus measure it about.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;One window work though thy might;<br />
One cubit of length and breadth make it,<br />
Upon the side a door shall fit<br />
For to come in and out.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Eating-places thou make also,<br />
Three roofed chambers, one or two:<br />
For with water I think to stow<sup><a href="#fn_22" id="fna_22">22</a></sup><br />
Man that I can make.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Destroyed all the world shall be,<br />
Save thou, thy wife, and sons three,<br />
And all their wives, also, with thee,<br />
Shall saved be for thy sake.</p>

<p><i>Noah.</i> Ah, Lord! I thank thee, loud and still,<br />
That to me art in such will,<br />
And spares me and my house to spill<br />
As now I soothly find.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy bidding, Lord, I shall fulfil,<br />
And never more thee grieve nor grill<sup><a href="#fn_23" id="fna_23">23</a></sup><br />
That such grace has sent me till<br />
Among all mankind.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have done you men and women all;<br />
Help, for aught that may befall,<br />
To work this ship, chamber, and hall,<br />
As God hath bidden us do.</p>

<p><i>Shem.</i> Father, I am already bowne,<sup><a href="#fn_3" id="fna_24-1">24</a></sup><br />
An axe I have, by my crown!<br />
As sharp as any in all this town<br />
For to go thereto.</p>

<p><i>Ham.</i> I have a hatchet, wonder keen,<br />
To bite well, as may be seen,<br />
A better ground one, as I ween,<br />
Is not in all this town.</p>

<p><i>Japhet.</i> And I can well make a pin,<br />
And with this hammer knock it in;<br />
Go and work without more din;<br />
And I am ready bowne.<sup><a href="#fn_24" id="fna_24-2">24</a></sup></p>

<p><i>Noah's Wife.</i> And we shall bring timber too,<br />
For women nothing else to do<br />
Women be weak to undergo<br />
Any great travail.</p>

<p><i>Shem's Wife.</i> Here is a good hackstock;<br />
On this you must hew and knock:<br />
Shall none be idle in this flock,<br />
Nor now may no man fail.</p>

<p><i>Ham's Wife.</i> And I will go to gather slich,<sup><a href="#fn_25" id="fna_25">25</a></sup><br />
The ship for to clean and pitch;<br />
Anointed it must be, every stitch,<br />
Board, tree, and pin.</p>

<p><i>Japhet's Wife.</i> And I will gather chips here<br />
To make a fire for you, in fear,<br />
And for to dight<sup><a href="#fn_26" id="fna_26">26</a></sup> your dinner,<br />
Against you come in.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Here they make signs as though they were working divers instruments.</i></p>

<p><i>Noah.</i> Now in the name of God I will begin,<br />
To make the ship that we shall in,<br />
That we be ready for to swim,<br />
At the coming of the flood.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;These boards I join together,<br />
To keep us safe from the weather<br />
That we may roam both hither and thither<br />
And safe be from this flood.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this tree will I have the mast,<br />
Tied with gables that will last<br />
With a sail yard for each blast<br />
And each thing in its kind.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;With topmast high and bowsprit.<br />
With cords and ropes, I hold all fit<br />
To sail forth at the next weete<sup><a href="#fn_27" id="fna_27">27</a></sup><br />
This ship is at an end.<br />
Wife in this castle we shall be kept:<br />
My children and thou I would in leaped!</p>

<p><i>Noah's Wife.</i> In faith, Noe, I had as lief thou had slept, for all thy frankishfare,<sup><a href="#fn_28" id="fna_28">28</a></sup><br />
For I will not do after thy rede.<sup><a href="#fn_29" id="fna_29">29</a></sup></p>

<p><i>Noah.</i> Good wife, do as I thee bid.</p>

<p><i>Noah's Wife.</i> By Christ not, or I see more need,<br />
Though thou stand all the day and rave.</p>

<p><i>Noah.</i> Lord, that women be crabbed aye!<br />
And never are meek, that I dare say.<br />
This is well seen of me to-day<br />
In witness of you each one.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Good wife, let be all this beere<sup><a href="#fn_30" id="fna_30">30</a></sup><br />
That thou makest in this place here,<br />
For they all ween thou art master;<br />
And so thou art, by St. John!</p>

<p><i>God.</i> Noah, take thou thy company<br />
And in the ship hie that you be,<br />
For none so righteous man to me<br />
Is now on earth living.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of clean beasts with thee thou take<br />
Seven and seven, or thou seake,<br />
He and she make to make<br />
Quickly in that thou bring.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of beasts unclean two and two,<br />
Male and female, without more;<br />
Of clean fowls seven also,<br />
The he and she together.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fowles unclean two, and no more;<br />
Of beasts as I said before:<br />
That shall be saved through my lore<br />
Against I send the weather.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all meats that must be eaten<br />
Into the ship look there be gotten,<br />
For that no way may be forgotten<br />
And do all this by deene.<sup><a href="#fn_31" id="fna_31">31</a></sup><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To sustain man and beasts therein,<br />
Aye, till the waters cease and blyn.<sup><a href="#fn_32" id="fna_32">32</a></sup><br />
This world is filled full of sin<br />
And that is now well seen.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven days be yet coming,<br />
You shall have space them in to bring;<br />
After that it is my liking<br />
Mankind for to annoy.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Forty days and forty nights,<br />
Rain shall fall for their unrights;<br />
And that I have made through my might,<br />
Now think I to destroy.</p>

<p><i>Noah.</i> Lord, at your bidding I am bayne,<sup><a href="#fn_33" id="fna_33">33</a></sup><br />
Since none other grace will gain,<br />
It will I fulfil fain,<br />
For gracious I thee find.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;A hundred winters and twenty<br />
This ship making tarried have I:<br />
If, through amendment, any mercy<br />
Would fall unto mankind.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have done, you men and women all.<br />
Hie you, lest this water fall,<br />
That each beast were in his stall<br />
And into ship brought.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of clean beasts seven shall be;<br />
Of unclean two, this God bade me;<br />
This flood is nigh, well may we see,<br />
Therefore tarry you nought.</p>

<p><i>Shem.</i> Sir, here are lions, leopards in,<br />
Horses, mares, oxen, and swine,<br />
Goats, calves, sheep, and kine,<br />
Here sitten<sup><a href="#fn_34" id="fna_34">34</a></sup> may you see.</p>

<p><i>Ham.</i> Camels, asses, men may find;<br />
Buck, doe, hart and hind,<br />
And beasts of all manner kind.<br />
Here be, as thinks me.</p>

<p><i>Japhet.</i> Take here cats and dogs too,<br />
Otter, fox, fulmart also;<br />
Hares, hopping gaily, can ye<br />
Have kail here for to eat.</p>

<p><i>Noah's Wife.</i> And here are bears, wolves set,<br />
Apes, owls, marmoset;<br />
Weasels, squirrels, and ferret<br />
Here they eat their meat.</p>

<p><i>Shem's Wife.</i> Yet more beasts are in this house!<br />
Here cats come in full crowse,<sup><a href="#fn_35" id="fna_35">35</a></sup><br />
Here a rat and here a mouse;<br />
They stand nigh together.</p>

<p><i>Ham's Wife.</i> And here are fowls less and more,<br />
Herons, cranes and bittern;<br />
Swans, peacocks, have them before!<br />
Meat for this weather.</p>

<p><i>Japhet's Wife.</i> Here are cocks, kites, crows,<br />
Rooks, ravens, many rows;<br />
Cuckoos, curlews, whoso knows,<br />
Each one in his kind.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And here are doves, ducks, drakes,<br />
Redshanks, running through the lakes,<br />
And each fowl that language makes<br />
In this ship men may find.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>In the stage direction the sons of Noah are enjoined to mention aloud
the names of the animals which enter; a representation of which, painted
on parchment, is to be carried by the actors.</i></p>

Thou art ever forward, that I dare swear:<br />
Come on God's half, time it were,<br />
For fear lest that we drown.</p>

<p><i>Noah's Wife.</i> Yea, sir, set up your sail<br />
And row forth with evil heale,<br />
For, without any fail,<br />
I will not out of this town.<br />

One foot further I will not go;<br />
They shall not drown, by St. John!<br />
If I may save their life.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;They loved me full well, by Christ!<br />
But thou wilt let them in thy chest,<br />
Else row forth, Noah, whither thou list,<br />
And get thee a new wife.</p>

<p><i>Noah.</i> Shem, some love thy mother, 'tis true;<br />
Forsooth, such another I do not know!</p>

<p><i>Shem.</i> Father, I shall set her in, I trow,<br />
Without any fail.<br />

And bids thee unto yonder ship wend,<sup><a href="#fn_36" id="fna_36">36</a></sup><br />
Look up and see the wind,<br />
For we be ready to sail.</p>

<p><i>Noah's Wife.</i> Son, go again to him and say<br />
I will not come therein to-day!</p>

<p><i>Noah.</i> Come in, wife, in twenty devils' way,<br />
Or else stand without.</p>

<p><i>Ham.</i> Shall we all fetch her in?</p>

<p><i>Noah.</i> Yea, sons, in Christ's blessing and mine,<br />
I would you hied you betime,<br />
For of this flood I am in doubt.</p>

<p><i>Japhet.</i> Mother, we pray you altogether,<br />
For we are here, your children;<br />
Come into the ship for fear of the weather,<br />
For his love that you bought!</p>

<p><i>Noah's Wife.</i> That I will not for your call,<br />
But if I have my gossips all.</p>

<p><i>Gossip.</i> The flood comes in full fleeting fast,<br />
On every side it broadens in haste;<br />
For fear of drowning I am aghast:<br />
Good gossip, let me come in!<br />

<p><i>Expositor</i> (<i>riding</i>). Lordings, what may this signify,<br />
I will expound openly<br />
That all, standing hereby,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;May know what this may be.<br />
This off'ring, I say verament,<sup><a href="#fn_60" id="fna_60">60</a></sup><br />
Signifieth the new Testament,<br />
That now is used with good intent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout all Christianity.<br />
In the old law without leasing,<sup><a href="#fn_61" id="fna_61">61</a></sup><br />
When these two good men were living,<br />
Of beasts was all their off'ring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And eke their sacrament.<br />
But since Christ died on the rood-tree,<br />
With bread and wine him worship we,<br />
And on Shrove Thursday in his maundy<sup><a href="#fn_62" id="fna_62">62</a></sup><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was his commandment.<br />
But for this thing used should be<br />
Afterward as now done we,<br />
In signification, believe you me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Melchisedec did so;<br />
And tithes-making, as you see here,<br />
Of Abraham beginning were.<br />
Therefore he was to God full dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And so were they both too.<br />
By Abraham understand I may<br />
The father of heaven in good fay,<sup><a href="#fn_63" id="fna_63">63</a></sup><br />
Melchisedec a priest to his pay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To minister that sacrament<br />
That Christ ordained on Shrove Thursday<br />
In bread and wine to honour him aye;<br />
This signifieth, the truth to say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Melchisedec's present.</p>

<p><i>God.</i> Abraham, my servant, I say to thee,<br />
Thy help and succour I will be,<br />
For thy good deed much pleaseth me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell thee surely.</p>

<p><i>Abraham.</i> Lord, one thing that thou wilt see,<br />
That I pray after with heart free,<br />
Grant me, Lord, through thy postye:<sup><a href="#fn_64" id="fna_64">64</a></sup><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some fruit of my body!<br />
I have no child, foul nor fair,<br />
Save my Nurry<sup><a href="#fn_65" id="fna_65">65</a></sup> to be my heir,<br />
That makes me greatly to apayre.<sup><a href="#fn_66" id="fna_66">66</a></sup><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;On me, Lord, have mercy!</p>

<p><i>God.</i> My friend, Abraham, leave thou me.<br />
Thy Nurry thine heir shall not be,<br />
But one son I shall send thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Begotten of thy body.<br />
Abraham, do as I thee say:<br />
Look up and tell,<sup><a href="#fn_67" id="fna_67">67</a></sup> and if thou may,<br />
Stars standing on the stray;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;That impossible were.<br />
No more shalt thou, for no need,<br />
Number of thy body the seed<br />
That thou shalt have withouten dreed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art to me so dear.<br />
Wherefore, Abraham, servant free,<br />
Look that thou be true to me,<br />
And fore-word here I make with thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy seed to multiply.<br />
So much more further shalt thou be,<br />
Kings of thy seed men shall see,<br />
And one child of great degree<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;All mankind shall forby.<sup><a href="#fn_68" id="fna_68">68</a></sup><br />
I will that from henceforth alway<br />
Each knave's child on the eighth day<br />
Be circumcised, as I say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thou thyself full soon;<br />
And who circumcised not is<br />
Forsaken shall be by me, I wis;<br />
For disobedient that man is,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore look that this be done.</p>

<p><i>Abraham.</i> Lord, already in good fay<sup><a href="#fn_69" id="fna_69">69</a></sup><br />
Blessed be thou, ever and aye;<br />
For that men truly know may<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy folk from other men,<br />
Circumcised they shall be all<br />
Anon for aught that may befall.<br />
I thank thee, Lord, thy own thrall,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;In th' old law truly ta'en.<br />
As followeth now verament,<sup><a href="#fn_70" id="fna_70">70</a></sup><br />
So was this in the old Testament;<br />
But when Christ, away it went,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And baptism then began.<br />
Also God promises here<br />
To Abraham, his servant dear,<br />
So much seed that in no manere<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Number'd it might be.<br />
And one seed, mankind to forby,<br />
That was Jesus Christ witterlye<sup><a href="#fn_71" id="fna_71">71</a></sup><br />

Smite off my head, and let me go!<br />
I pray you, rid me of my woe;<br />

<h3>THE WAKEFIELD SECOND NATIVITY PLAY</h3>



<p><i>1st Shepherd.</i> Lord! what, these weathers are cold, and I am ill happed;<br />
I am near hand-dold,<sup><a href="#fn_86" id="fna_86">86</a></sup> so long have I napped;<br />
My legs bend and fold, my fingers are chapped,<br />
It is not as I would, for I am all lapped<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In sorrow.<br />
In storms and tempest,<br />
Now in the east, now in the west,<br />
Woe is him has never rest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mid day nor morrow.<br />
But we silly shepherds, that walk upon the moor,<br />
In faith, we are near hands out of the door;<br />
No wonder, as it stands, if we be poor,<br />
For the tilth of our lands lies fallow as the floor,<br />
We are so lamed,<br />
So taxed and shamed,<br />
We are made hand-tamed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;With these gentlery-men.<br />
Thus they rieve us of rest, Our Lady them wary,<br />
These men that are lord-fest,<sup><a href="#fn_87" id="fna_87">87</a></sup> they cause the plough tarry.<br />
That men say is for the best, we find it contrary,<br />
Thus are husbands<sup><a href="#fn_88" id="fna_88">88</a></sup> opprest, in point to miscarry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In life.<br />
Thus hold they us under,<br />
Thus they bring us in blunder,<br />
It were great wonder,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And ever should we thrive.<br />
For may he get a paint sleeve,<sup><a href="#fn_89" id="fna_89">89</a></sup> or a brooch now on days,<br />
Woe is he that shall grieve, or once again says,<br />
Dare no man him reprieve, what mast'ry he has,<br />
And yet may none believe one word that he says--<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;No letter.<br />
He can make purveyance,<br />
With boast and bragance,<sup><a href="#fn_90" id="fna_90">90</a></sup><br />
And all through maintenance,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of men that are greater.<br />
There shall come a swain, as proud as a po,<sup><a href="#fn_91" id="fna_91">91</a></sup><br />
He must borrow my wain, my plough also,<br />
Then I am full fain to grant or he go.<br />
Thus live we in pain, anger, and woe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;By night and day;<br />
He must have if he long&eacute;d<br />
If I should forgang<sup><a href="#fn_92" id="fna_92">92</a></sup> it,<br />
I were better be hang&eacute;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than once say him nay.<br />
It does me good, as I walk thus by mine own,<br />
Of this world for to talk in manner of moan<br />
To my sheep will I stalk and hearken anon<br />
There abide on a balk, or sit on a stone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Full soon.<br />
For I trow, pardie!<br />
True men if they be,<br />
We get more company<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or it be noon.</p>

<p><i>2nd Shepherd.</i> "Beniste"<sup><a href="#fn_93" id="fna_93">93</a></sup> and "Dominus!" what may this bemean?<br />
Why fares this world thus, oft have we not seen.<br />
Lord, these weathers are spitous,<sup><a href="#fn_94" id="fna_94">94</a></sup> and the weather full keen;<br />
And the frost so hideous they water mine een,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;No lie.<br />
Now in dry, now in wet,<br />
Now in snow, now in sleet,<br />
When my shoon freeze to my feet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not all easy.<br />
But as far as I ken, or yet as I go,<br />
We silly wed-men dree mickle woe;<sup><a href="#fn_95" id="fna_95">95</a></sup><br />
We have sorrow then and then, it falls often so,<br />
Silly capyl, our hen, both to and fro<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;She cackles,<br />
But begin she to croak,<br />
To groan or to cluck,<br />
Woe is him, say of our cock,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For he is in the shackles.<br />
These men that are wed, have not all their will,<br />
When they are full hard sted,<sup><a href="#fn_96" id="fna_96">96</a></sup> they sigh full still;<br />
God wait they are led full hard and full ill,<br />
In bower nor in bed they say not there till<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;This tide.<br />
My part have I found,<br />
My lesson is learn'd,<br />
Woe is him that is bound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For he must abide.<br />
But now late in our lives, a marvel to me,<br />
That I think my heart rives,<sup><a href="#fn_97" id="fna_97">97</a></sup> such wonders to see,<br />
What that destiny drives it should so be,<br />
Some men will have two wives, and some men three,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In store.<br />
Some are woe that have any;<br />
But so far ken I,<br />
Woe is he who has many,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For he feels it sore.<br />
But young men of wooing, for God that you bought,<br />
Be well ware of wedding, and think in your thought<br />
"Had I wist" is a thing it serves ye of nought;<br />
Mickle still mourning has wedding home brought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And griefs,<br />
With many a sharp shower,<br />
For thou may catch in an hour<br />
That shall serve thee full sour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as thou lives.<br />
For as read I epistle, I have one to my fear<br />
As sharp as a thistle, as rough as a brere.<sup><a href="#fn_98" id="fna_98">98</a></sup><br />
She is browed like a bristle with a sour lenten cheer;<br />
Had she once wet her whistle she could sing full clear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her pater-noster.<br />
She is as great as a whale,<br />
She has a gallon of gall;<br />
By him that died for us all!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would I had run till I lost her.</p>

<p><i>1st Shepherd.</i> God look over the row, full deafly ye stand.</p>

<p><i>2nd Shepherd.</i> Yea, the devil in thy maw!--so tariand,<sup><a href="#fn_99" id="fna_99">99</a></sup><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw thou aught now of Daw?</p>

<p><i>1st Shepherd.</i>                Yea, on a lea land<br />
Heard I him blow, he comes here at hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far;<br />
Stand still.</p>

<p><i>2nd Shepherd.</i> Why?</p>

<p><i>1st Shepherd.</i> For he comes here, hope I.</p>

<p><i>2nd Shepherd.</i> He will make us both a lie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;But if we beware.</p>

<p><i>3rd Shepherd.</i> Christ's cross me speed, and Saint Nicholas!<br />
Thereof had I need, it is worse than it was.<br />
Whoso could take heed, and let the world pass,<br />
It is ever in dread and brittle as glass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And slithers,<sup><a href="#fn_100" id="fna_100">100</a></sup><br />
This world fared never so,<br />
With marvels mo and mo,<sup><a href="#fn_101" id="fna_101">101</a></sup><br />
Now in weal, now in woe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all things withers.<br />
Was never since Noah's flood such floods seen,<br />
Winds and rains so rude, and storms so keen,<br />
Some stammered, some stood in doubt, as I ween,<br />
Now God turn all to good, I say as I mean,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For ponder.<br />
These floods so they drown<br />
Both in fields and in town,<br />
They bear all down,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And that is a wonder.<br />
We that walk in the nights, our cattle to keep,<br />
We see sudden sights, when other men sleep:<br />
Yet methinks my heart lights, I see shrews peep,<br />
Ye are two, all wights,<sup><a href="#fn_102" id="fna_102">102</a></sup> I will give my sheep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;A turn.<br />
But full ill have I meant,<br />
As I walk on this bent,<sup><a href="#fn_103" id="fna_103">103</a></sup><br />
I may lightly repent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;My toes if I spurn.<br />
Ah, sir, God you save, and master mine!<br />
A drink fain would I have and somewhat to dine.</p>

<p><i>1st Shepherd.</i> Christ's curs, my knave, thou art a lazy hyne.<sup><a href="#fn_104" id="fna_104">104</a></sup></p>

<p><i>2nd Shepherd.</i> What, the boy list rave. Abide until syne<sup><a href="#fn_105" id="fna_105">105</a></sup><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made it.<br />
I'll thrift on thy pate!<br />
Though the shrew came late<br />
Yet is he in state<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To dine if he had it.</p>

<p><i>3rd Shepherd.</i> Such servants as I, that sweats and swinks,<br />
Eats our bread full dry, and that me forthinks;<br />
We are oft wet and weary when master men winks,<br />
Yet comes full lately both dinners and drinks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;But neatly.<br />
Both our dame and our sire,<br />
When we have run in the mire,<br />
They can nip at our hire,<sup><a href="#fn_106" id="fna_106">106</a></sup><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And pay us full lately.<br />
But hear my truth, master, for the fare that ye make<br />
I shall do thereafter work, as I take;<br />
I shall do a little, sir, and strive and still lack,<br />
For yet lay my supper never on my stomack<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In fields.<br />
Whereto should I threap?<sup><a href="#fn_107" id="fna_107">107</a></sup><br />
With my staff can I leap,<br />
And men say "light cheap<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Letherly for yields."<sup><a href="#fn_108" id="fna_108">108</a></sup></p>

<p><i>1st Shepherd.</i> Thou wert an ill lad, to ride on wooing<br />
With a man that had but little of spending.</p>

<p><i>2nd Shepherd.</i> Peace, boy!--I bade: no more jangling,<br />
Or I shall make thee afraid, by the heaven's king!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;With thy gawds;<br />
Where are our sheep, boy, we scorn?</p>

<p><i>3rd Shepherd.</i> Sir, this same day at morn,<br />
I them left in the corn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;When they rang lauds;<br />
They have pasture good, they cannot go wrong.</p>

<p><i>1st Shepherd.</i> That is right by the rood, these nights are long,<br />
Yet I would, or we yode,<sup><a href="#fn_109" id="fna_109">109</a></sup> one gave us a song.</p>

<p><i>2nd Shepherd.</i> So I thought as I stood, to mirth us among.<sup><a href="#fn_110" id="fna_110">110</a></sup></p>

<p><i>3rd Shepherd.</i> I grant.</p>

<p><i>1st Shepherd.</i> Let me sing the tenory.</p>

<p><i>2nd Shepherd.</i> And I the treble so high.</p>

<p><i>3rd Shepherd.</i> Then the mean falls to me;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let see how ye chaunt.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Mac enters, with a cloak thrown over his smock.</i></p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> Now, Lord, for thy names seven, that made both moon and starns<sup><a href="#fn_111" id="fna_111">111</a></sup><br />
Well more than I can even: thy will, Lord, of my thorns;<br />
I am all uneven, that moves oft my horns,<sup><a href="#fn_112" id="fna_112">112</a></sup><br />
Now would God I were in heaven, for there weep no bairns<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;So still.</p>

<p><i>1st Shepherd.</i> Who is that pipes so poor?</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> Would God ye knew how I fare!<br />
Lo, a man that walks on the moor,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And has not all his will.</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> Good wife, open the hek.<sup><a href="#fn_131" id="fna_131">131</a></sup> See'st thou not what I bring?</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> I may let thee draw the sneck. Ah! come in, my sweeting.</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> Yea, thou dost not reck of my long standing.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> By thy naked neck, thou art like for to hang.</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i>                              Go away:<br />
I am worthy of my meat,<br />

More than they that swinck<sup><a href="#fn_132" id="fna_132">132</a></sup> and sweat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;All the long day,<br />
Thus it fell to my lot, Gill, I had such grace.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> It were a foul blot to be hanged for the case.</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> I have scaped, Jelott, oft as hard as glass.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> "But so long goes the pot to the water," men says,<br />
"At last comes it home broken."</p>

I would he were flayn;<sup><a href="#fn_133" id="fna_133">133</a></sup> I list we'll eat:<br />

<p><i>Mac.</i> Then might I be ta'en: that were a cold sweat.<br />
Go bar<br />

<p><i>Wife.</i>                Yes, Mac,<br />
For and they come at thy back.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil of them war!<sup><a href="#fn_134" id="fna_134">134</a></sup></p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> A good bowrde<sup><a href="#fn_135" id="fna_135">135</a></sup> have I spied, since thou can none:<br />
Here shall we him hide, till they be gone;<br />
In my cradle abide. Let me alone,<br />
And I shall lie beside in childbed and groan.</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i>                   Thou red?<sup><a href="#fn_136" id="fna_136">136</a></sup><br />

Of a knave child this night.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> Now well is my day bright,<br />

This is a good guise and a far cast;<br />
Yet a woman's advice helps at the last.<br />
I care never who spies: again go thou fast.</p>

<p><i>Mac.</i> But I come or they rise; else blows a cold blast--<br />

<h3>THE COVENTRY NATIVITY PLAY</h3>




<p>PROLOGUE</p>


<p><i>Isaiah.</i> The sovereign that seeth every secret<br />
He save you all and make you perfect and strong:<br />
And give his grace with his mercy thereto meet,<br />
For now in great misery mankind is bound.<br />
The serpent hath given us so mortal a wound<br />
That no creature is able us for to release<br />
Till the right unction of Judah doth cease.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then shall much mirth and joy increase<br />
And the right root in Israel spring,<br />
That shall bring forth the grain of holiness:<br />
And out of danger he shall us bring<br />
Into that region where he is king:<br />
Which above all other doth abound<br />
And that cruel Satan he shall confound.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore I come here upon this ground,<br />
To comfort every creature of birth;<br />
For I, Isaiah, the prophet, hath found<br />
Many sweet matters, whereof we may make mirth<br />
On this same wise.<br />
For though Adam be doomed to death<br />
With all his children, as Abel and Seth:<br />
Yet, <i>Ecce virgo concipiet!</i><sup><a href="#fn_215" id="fna_215">215</a></sup><br />
Lo, where a remedy shall rise!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold a maid shall conceive a child,<br />
And get us more grace than ever man had.<br />
And her maidenhood nothing defiled:<br />
She is deputed to bear the Son, Almighty God.<br />
Lo, sovereignties now may you be glad,<br />
For of this maiden all we may be fain;<sup><a href="#fn_216" id="fna_216">216</a></sup><br />
For Adam that now lies in sorrows full sad,<br />
Her glorious birth shall redeem him again<br />
From bondage and thrall.<br />
Now be merry every man,<br />
For this deed briefly in Israel shall be done,<br />
And before the Father on his throne<br />
That shall glad us all.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;More of this matter fain would I move,<br />
But longer time I have not here for to dwell.<br />
That lord that is merciful, his mercy so in us may prove<br />
For to save our souls from the darkness of hell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And to his bliss--he us bring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;As he is--both lord and king;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And shall be everlasting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>In secula seculos</i>:<sup><a href="#fn_217" id="fna_217">217</a></sup> Amen.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Enter Gabriel to Mary.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Gabriel.</i> Hail! Mary, full of grace,<br />
Our Lord God is with thee!<br />
Above all women that ever was;<br />
Lady, blessed may thou be.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Almighty Father and King of bliss<br />
From all dyskes<sup><a href="#fn_218" id="fna_218">218</a></sup> thou save me now:<br />
For inwardly my spirit troubled is,<br />
I am amazed and know not how.</p>

<p><i>Gabriel.</i> Dread thee nothing, maiden, of this:<br />
From heaven above hither am I sent,<br />
Of embassage from that King of bliss,<br />
Unto the lady and virgin reverent,<br />
Saluting thee here as most excellent,<br />
Whose virtue above all other doth abound;<br />
Wherefore in thee grace shall be found:<br />
For thou shalt conceive upon this ground<br />
The Second Person of God on throne;<br />
He will be born of thee alone,<br />
Without sin tho shalt him see.<br />
Thy grace and thy goodness will never be gone<br />
But ever to live in virginity.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> I marvel sore how that may be:<br />
Man's company knew I never yet,<br />
Nor never to do cast I me,<br />
While that our Lord sendeth me my wit.</p>

<p><i>Gabriel.</i> The Holy Ghost in thee shall light,<br />
And shall endue thy soul so with virtue<br />
From the Father that is on high:<br />
These words, turtle, they be full true.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;This child that of thee shall be born<br />
Is the Second Person in Trinity.<br />
He shall save that was forlorn,<br />
And the fiend's power destroy shall he.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;These words, lady, full true they be,<br />
And further, lady, in thy own lineage,<br />
Behold Elizabeth, thy cousin clean,<br />
The which was barren and past all age.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And now with child she hath been<br />
Six months and more as shall be seen;<br />
Wherefore, discomfort thee not, Mary,<br />
For to God impossible nothing may be.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Now and it be that Lord's will<br />
Of my body to be born and for to be<br />
His high pleasure for to fulfil,<br />
As his one handmaid I submit me.</p>

<p><i>Gabriel.</i> Now blessed be the time set<br />
That thou wast born in thy degree:<br />
For now is the knot surely knit<br />
And God conceived in Trinity.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now farewell lady of might most,<br />
Unto the Godhead I thee beteyche.<sup><a href="#fn_219" id="fna_219">219</a></sup></p>

And lowly he lead me and be my leech.<sup><a href="#fn_220" id="fna_220">220</a></sup></p>

<p><i>Joseph.</i> Mary, my wife so dear!<br />
How do ye, dame, and what cheer<br />
Is with you this tide?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Truly, husband, I am here<br />
Our Lord's will for to abide.</p>

<p><i>Joseph.</i> What! I trow we be all shent!<sup><a href="#fn_221" id="fna_221">221</a></sup><br />
Say, woman, who hath been here since I went<br />
To rage with thee?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Sir, here was neither man, nor man's even,<sup><a href="#fn_222" id="fna_222">222</a></sup><br />
But only the sond<sup><a href="#fn_223" id="fna_223">223</a></sup> of our Lord God in heaven.</p>

<p><i>Joseph.</i> Say not so, woman, for shame let be:<br />
Ye be with child so wondrous great,<br />
Ye need no more thereof to treat<br />
Against all right.<br />
For sooth this child, dame, is not mine;<br />
Alas, that ever with my eyne<sup><a href="#fn_224" id="fna_224">224</a></sup><br />
I should see this sight.<br />
Tell me, woman, whose is this child?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> None but yours, husband, so mild<br />
And that shall be seen, I wis.</p>

<p><i>Joseph.</i> But mine, alas! alas! why say ye so?<br />
Well away, woman, now may I go<br />
Beguiled as many another is.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Nay truly, sir, ye be not beguiled<br />
Nor yet with spot of sin I am not defiled;<br />
Trust it well, husband.</p>

<p><i>Joseph.</i> Husband in faith, and that acold;<br />
Ah well away, Joseph, as thou art old!<br />
Like a fool now may I stand<br />
And truss; but in faith, Mary, thou art in sin.<br />
So much as I have cherished thee, dame, and all thy kin,<br />
Behind my back to serve me thus:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;All old men example take by me,<br />
How I am beguiled here may you see,<br />
To wed so young a child.<br />
Now farewell, Mary, I leave thee here alone,<br />
Woe worth thee dame, and thy works each one!<br />
For I will no more be beguiled<br />
For friend nor foe.<br />
Now of this deed I am so dull<br />
And of my life I am so full,<br />
No farther may I go.</p>

<p><i>Angel.</i> Arise up, Joseph, and go home again<br />
Unto Mary thy wife that is so free;<br />
To comfort her look that thou be fain,<br />
For, Joseph, a clean maiden is she.<br />
She hath conceived without any trayne<br />
The Second Person in Trinity:<br />
Jesu shall be his name certainly,<br />
And all this world save shall he.<br />
Be not aghast.</p>

<p><i>Joseph.</i> Now, Lord, I thank thee with heart full sad.<br />
For of these tidings I am so glad<br />
That all my care away is cast,<br />
Wherefore to Mary I will in haste.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, Mary, Mary, I kneel full low,<br />
Forgive me, sweet wife, here in this land;<br />
Mercy, Mary, for now I know<br />
Of your good governance and how it doth stand:<br />
Though that I did thee misname.<br />
Mercy, Mary, while I live<br />
Will I never, sweet wife, thee grieve,<br />
In earnest nor in game.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Now, that Lord in Heaven, sir,--he you forgive!<br />
And I do forgive you in his name<br />
For evermore.</p>

<p><i>Joseph.</i> Now truly, sweet wife, to you I say the same;<br />
But now to Bethlehem must I wynde<sup><a href="#fn_225" id="fna_225">225</a></sup><br />
And show myself so full of care,<br />
And I to leave you this great behind,<br />
God wot, the while, dame, how you should fare.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Nay hardily, husband, dread ye nothing,<br />
For I will walk with you on the way.<br />
I trust in God, Almighty King,<br />
To speed right well in our journey.</p>

<p><i>Joseph.</i> Now I thank you, Mary, of your goodness<br />
That you my words will not blame;<br />
And since that to Bethlehem we shall us address<br />
Go we together in God's holy name.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>They set out on their way.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to Bethlehem have we leagues three,<br />
The day is nigh spent, it draweth towards night,<br />
Fain at your ease, dame, I would that ye should be:<br />
For you grow all weary, it seemeth, in my sight.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> God have mercy, Joseph, my spouse, so dear!<br />
All prophets hereto do bear witness<br />
The evry time now draweth near<br />
That my child will be born, which is King of bliss.<br />
Unto some place, Joseph, kindly me lead,<br />
That I might rest me with grace in this tide,<br />
The light of the Father over us both spread<br />
And the grace of my son with us here abide.</p>

<p><i>Joseph.</i> Lo, blessed Mary, here shall ye lend;<sup><a href="#fn_226" id="fna_226">226</a></sup><br />
Chief chosen of our Lord, and cleanest in degree:<br />
And I for help to town, will I wend.<br />
Is not this the best, dame, what say ye?</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> God have mercy! Joseph, my husband, so meek,<br />
And I heartily pray you go now from me.</p>

<p><i>Joseph.</i> That shall be done in haste, Mary, so sweet!<br />
The comfort of the Holy Ghost leave I with thee.<br />
Now to Bethlehem strait will I go,<br />
To get some help for Mary so free,<br />
Some help of women, God may me send!<br />
That Mary, full of grace, pleased may be.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Enter a Shepherd.</i></p>

<p><i>1st Shepherd.</i> Now God that art in Trinity,<br />
Thou sawest my fellows and me;<br />
For I know not where my sheep nor they be,<br />
This night it is so cold,<br />
Now is it nigh the middest of the night,<br />
These weathers are dark and dim of light,<br />
That of them can I have no sight,<br />
Standing here on this wold.<br />
But now to make their hearts light,<br />
Now will I full right<br />
Stand upon this loe.<sup><a href="#fn_227" id="fna_227">227</a></sup><br />
And to them cry with all my might:<br />
Full well my voice they know,<br />
What ho, fellows, ho, hoo, ho!</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Enter two other Shepherds.</i></p>

<p><i>2nd Shepherd.</i> Hark, Sym, hark, I hear our brother on the loe,<sup><a href="#fn_227" id="fna_227-2">227</a></sup><br />
This is his voice, right well I know,<br />
Therefore towards him let us go,<br />
And follow his voice aright,<br />
See, Sym, see where he doth stand;<br />
I am right glad we have him found.<br />
Brother! where hast thou been so long,<br />
And it is so cold this night?</p>

<p><i>1st Shepherd.</i> Oh, friends! there came a pyrie<sup><a href="#fn_228" id="fna_228">228</a></sup> of wind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;With a mist suddenly,<br />
That forth off my ways went I,<br />
And great heaviness then made I,<br />
And was full sore afright;<br />
Then for to go wist I not whither,<br />
But travelled on this hill hither and thither.<br />
I was so weary of this cold weather,<br />
That near passed was my might.</p>

<p><i>3rd Shepherd.</i> Brother, now we be past that fright,<br />
And it is far within the night:<br />
Full soon will spring the daylight,<br />
It draweth full near the tide.<br />
Here awhile let us rest<br />
And repast ourselves of the best.<br />
Till that the sun rise in the east,<br />
Let us all here abide.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>There the Shepherds draw forth their meat, and do eat and drink, and
as they drink they see the star and say thus:</i></p>

<p>Brother, look up and behold,<br />
What thing is yonder that shineth so bright?<br />
As long as ever I have watched my fold,<br />
Yet saw I never such a sight<br />
In field.<br />
Aha! now is come the time that old fathers hath told,<br />
That in the winter's night so cold,<br />
A child of maiden born, be he would,<br />
In whom all prophecies shall be fulfilled.</p>

<p><i>1st Shepherd.</i> Truth it is without nay,<br />
So said the prophet Isaye,<br />
That a child should be born of a maid so bright<br />
In winter nigh the shortest day,<br />
Or else in the middest of the night.</p>

<p><i>2nd Shepherd.</i> Loved be God, most of might!<br />
That our grace is to see that sight;<br />
Pray we to him as it is right<br />
If that his will it be,<br />
That we may have knowledge of this signification,<br />
And why it appeareth on this fashion<br />
And ever to him let us give laudation,<br />
In earth, while that we be.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>There the angels sing "Gloria in Excelsis Deo."</i></p>

To hear their harmony?</p>

<p><i>2nd Shepherd.</i> Glory, <i>Gloria in Excelsis</i>, that was their song,<br />
How say ye fellows! said they not thus?</p>

Of what manner a thing?</p>

<p><i>1st Prophet.</i> Were it mystical unto your hearing,--<br />
Of the nativity of a king?</p>

<p><i>2nd Prophet.</i> Of a king?<br />
Whence should he come?</p>

<p><i>1st Prophet.</i> From that region royal and mighty mansion,<br />
The seed celestial and heavenly wisdom,<br />
The Second Person, and God's one Son,<br />
For our sake is man become.<br />
This godly sphere, descended here,<br />
Into a virgin clear,<br />
She undefiled,<br />
By whose work, obscure our frail nature<br />
Is now beguiled.</p>

<p><i>2nd Prophet.</i> Why, hath she a child?</p>

<p><i>1st Prophet.</i> Ah, trust it well,<br />
And never the less,<br />
Yet is she a maid even as she was,<br />
And her son the king of Israel.</p>

<p><i>2nd Prophet.</i> A wonderful marvel, How that may be,<br />
And far doth excel--<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;All our capacity,<br />
How that the trinity,<br />

Should joined be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto our mortality.</p>

For the which cause he,<br />

And live in misery<br />

Impossible to be, there is nothing;<br />

Than to be doubting.</p>

<p><i>2nd Prophet.</i> Yet doubts ofttimes hath derivation.</p>

Of truths to have a due probation,--<br />
By the same doubts, reasoning.</p>

This child's lineage.</p>

<p><i>2nd Prophet.</i> And why in that wise?</p>

To count the parent on the man's line,<br />
And not on the feminine,<br />
Amongst us here in Israel.</p>

How this child born should be without nature's prejudice.</p>

<p><i>1st Prophet.</i> Nay, no prejudice unto nature I dare well say,<br />
For the king of nature may<br />
Have all his one will,<br />
Did not the power of God, make Aaron's rod<br />

Than the sun so clear<br />

And they these tidings told.</p>

In what pile or castle,<br />
These herdmen did him see.</p>

Born would he not be,<br />
Neither in castles, nor yet in towers,<br />

<p><i>1st Prophet.</i> Forth they went, and glad they were;<br />
Going they did sing,<br />
With mirth and solace, they made good cheer,<br />
For joy of that new tiding.<br />
And after as I heard them tell,<br />

He granted them heaven therein to dwell.<br />

<p><i>Herald.</i> Hail, King most worthiest in wede!<sup><a href="#fn_257" id="fna_257">257</a></sup><br />
Hail, maintainer of courtesy through all this world wide!<br />
Hail, the most mightiest that ever bestrode a steed!<br />

Hail in thine honour!<br />
These three kings that forth were sent<br />

Contrary to thine honour.</p>

Might them I take I should them burn at a glede.<sup><a href="#fn_258" id="fna_258">258</a></sup><br />

<p>Eh! and that kerne<sup><a href="#fn_260" id="fna_260">260</a></sup> of Bethlehem, he shall be dead,<br />
And thus shall I do for his prophecy.<br />
How say you, sir knights, is not this the best red,<sup><a href="#fn_261" id="fna_261">261</a></sup><br />
That all young children for this should be dead<br />
With sword to be slain?<br />
Then shall I, Herod, live in lede,<sup><a href="#fn_262" id="fna_262">262</a></sup><br />
And all folk me doubt and dread,<br />
And offer to me both gold, riches, and mede,<sup><a href="#fn_263" id="fna_263">263</a></sup><br />
Thereto will they be full fain.</p>

<p><i>1st Soldier.</i> My Lord, King Herod by name,<br />
Thy words against my will shall be<br />
To see so many young children die, is shame;<br />
Therefore counsel thereto gettest thou none of me.</p>

<p><i>2nd Soldier.</i> Well said, fellow, my troth I plight;<br />
Sir king! perceive right well you may<br />
So great a murder to see of young fruit,<br />
Will make a rising in thine own countrey.</p>

<p><i>Herod.</i> A rising!--out! out! out!</p>

<p>Out villain wretches, hereupon you I cry,<br />
My will utterly, look that it be wrought,<br />

By Mahound, most mightiest, that me dear hath bought!</p>

<p><i>1st Soldier.</i> Now, cruel Herod, sith we shall do this deed,<br />
Your will needfully in this must be wrought.<br />
All the children of that age, die they must need,<br />
Now with all my might they shall be upsought.</p>

<p><i>2nd Soldier.</i> And I will swear here upon your bright sword,<br />
All the children that I find, slain they shall be;<br />
That make many a mother to weep, and be full sore afeard,<br />
In our armour bright, when they us see.</p>

<p><i>Herod.</i> Now you have sworn, forth that ye go<br />
And my will that ye work both by day and night,<br />
And then will I for fain trip like a doe;<br />
But when they be dead, I warn you, bring them before my sight.</p>

<p><i>Angel.</i> Mary and Joseph, to you I say,<br />
Sweet word from the Father I bring you full right;<br />
Out of Bethlehem into Egypt forth go ye the way<br />
And with you take the king, full of might,<br />
For dread of Herod's red.<sup><a href="#fn_264" id="fna_264">264</a></sup></p>

Stand as still as stone in wall,<br />
Whiles ye are present in my sight,<br />
That none of ye clatter nor call;<br />
For if ye do, your death is dight.<br />
I warn it you both great and small,<br />
With this brand burnished so bright,<br />
Therefore in peace look ye be all.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;What? peace, in the devil's name!<br />
Harlots and dastards all bedene<sup><a href="#fn_273" id="fna_273">273</a></sup><br />
On gallows ye be made full tame.<br />
Thieves and michers ken<sup><a href="#fn_274" id="fna_274">274</a></sup><br />
Will ye not peace when I bid you?<br />
By Mahoun's blood! if ye me teyn,<sup><a href="#fn_275" id="fna_275">275</a></sup><br />
I shall ordain soon for you<br />
Pains that never e'er was seen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And that anon:<br />
Be ye so bold beggars, I warn you,<br />
Full boldly shall I beat you,<br />
To hell the de'il shall draw you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Body, back, and bone.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a lord that mickle is of might,<br />
Prince of all Jewry, Sir Pilate I hight.<br />
Next bring Herod, greatest of all,<br />
Bow to my bidding, both great and small,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or else be ye shent;<sup><a href="#fn_276" id="fna_276">276</a></sup><br />
Therefore keep your tongues, I warn you all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And unto us take tent.<sup><a href="#fn_277" id="fna_277">277</a></sup></p>

<p><i>1st Torturer.</i> All peace, all peace, among you all!<br />
And hearken now what shall befall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To this false chuffer<sup><a href="#fn_278" id="fna_278">278</a></sup> here.<br />
That with his false quantyse<sup><a href="#fn_279" id="fna_279">279</a></sup><br />
Has made himself as God wise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Among us many a year.<br />
He calls himself a prophet,<br />
And says that he can bales<sup><a href="#fn_280" id="fna_280">280</a></sup> beat<sup><a href="#fn_281" id="fna_281">281</a></sup><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And make all things amend,<br />
But e'er long know we shall,<br />
Whether he can overcome his own bale,<sup><a href="#fn_280" id="fna_280-2">280</a></sup><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or 'scape out of our hand.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Was not this a wonder thing<br />
That he durst call himself a king<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And make so great a lie?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;But, by Mahoun! while I may live,<br />
Those proud words shall I never forgive,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he be hanged on high.</p>

<p><i>2nd Torturer.</i> His pride, fie, we set at nought,<br />
But each man reckon in his thought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And look that we naught want;<br />
For I shall seek, if that I may,<br />
By the order of knighthood, to-day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To make his heart pant.</p>

<p><i>3rd Torturer.</i> And so shall I, with all my might,<br />
Abate his pride this very night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And reckon him a crede.<br />
Lo! he lets on he could no ill,<br />
But he can aye, when he will,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Do a full foul deed.</p>

<p><i>4th Torturer.</i> Ye fellows, ye, as I, have rest,<br />

Look that we have what we need too<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For to hold strait this shrew.</p>

<p><i>1st Torturer.</i> That was a noble rede;<br />
Lo, here I have a band,<br />
If need be, to bind his hand;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;This thong, I trow, will last.</p>

<p><i>2nd Torturer.</i> And one to the other side,<br />
That shall abate his pride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;If it be but drawn fast.</p>

<p><i>3rd Torturer.</i> Lo, here a hammer and nails also<br />
For to fasten fast our foe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To this tree full soon.</p>

<p><i>4th Torturer.</i> You are wise, withouten dread,<br />
That so can help yourself at need<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To thing that should be done.</p>

<p><i>1st Torturer.</i> Now dare I say hardily,<br />
He shall with all his mawmentry<sup><a href="#fn_284" id="fna_284">284</a></sup><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer us be-tell.</p>

Have done, quickly, let it be seen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;How we can with him mell.<sup><a href="#fn_285" id="fna_285">285</a></sup></p>

<p><i>3rd Torturer.</i> Now we are at the Mount of Calvary,<br />
Have done, fellows, and let now see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;How we can with him play.</p>

<p><i>4th Torturer.</i> Yes, for as proud as he can look,<br />
He would have turned another crook,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had he the rack to-day.</p>

<p><i>1st Torturer.</i> In faith, sir, since ye called you a king,<br />
You must prove a worthy thing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;That falls into the weir.<br />
You must joust in tournament,<br />
But sit you fast, else you'll be shent,<sup><a href="#fn_286" id="fna_286">286</a></sup><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Else down I shall you bear.</p>

<p><i>2nd Torturer.</i> If thou be God's son, as thou tells,<br />
Thou canst save thyself--how shouldst thou else?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Else were it marvel great;<br />
And canst thou not, we will not trow<br />
What thou has said, but make thee mow<br />

I promise thee thou bidest a shaft<br />
If thou sitt'st not well thou hadst better laft<sup><a href="#fn_290" id="fna_290">290</a></sup><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The tales that thou hast told.</p>

How we can horse our king so free<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;By any craft;<br />
Stand thou yonder on yon side,<br />
And we shall see how he can ride.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And how to wield a shaft.</p>

<p><i>1st Torturer.</i> Sir, come ye hither, and have done,<br />
And get upon your palfrey soon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For he is ready bowne:<sup><a href="#fn_291" id="fna_291">291</a></sup><br />
If ye be bound to him be not wroth,<br />
For be ye secure we were full loth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;On any wise that ye fell down.</p>

<p><i>2nd Torturer.</i> Knit thou a knot, with all thy strength<br />
For to draw this arm at length<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it come to the bore.</p>

<p><i>3rd Torturer.</i> Thou art mad, man, by this light!<br />
It wants, in each man's sight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Another half span, and more.</p>

<p><i>4th Torturer.</i> Yet draw out this arm, and make it fast,<br />
With this rope, that well will last,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And each man lay hand to.</p>

<p><i>1st Torturer.</i> Yes, and bind thou fast that band,<br />
We shall go to that other hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And look what we can do.</p>

<p><i>2nd Torturer.</i> Do drive a nail there throughout,<br />
And then there shall nothing doubt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For it will not <i>breste</i>.<sup><a href="#fn_292" id="fna_292">292</a></sup></p>

<p><i>3rd Torturer.</i> That shall I do, so might I thrive,<br />
For to hammer and to drive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereto I am full pressed;<br />
So let it stick, for it is well.</p>

<p><i>4th Torturer.</i> Thou sayest sooth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;There can no man mend.</p>

<p><i>1st Torturer.</i> Hold down his knees.</p>

<p><i>2nd Torturer.</i>            That shall I do.<br />
His nurse did never better do;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay on with each hand.</p>

<p><i>3rd Torturer.</i> Draw out his limbs, let see, have at.</p>

<p><i>4th Torturer.</i> That was well drawn out, that,<br />
Fair befall him that so pulled!<br />
For to have gotten it to the mark<br />
I trow laymen nor clerk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing better should!</p>

<p><i>1st Torturer.</i> Hold it now fast there<br />
One of you the bore shall bear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then it may not fail.</p>

<p><i>2nd Torturer.</i> That shall I do withouten dread,<br />
As ever might I well speed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Him to mickle bale.</p>

<p><i>3rd Torturer.</i> So, that is well, it will not brest,<sup><a href="#fn_293" id="fna_293">293</a></sup><br />
But now, let see, who does the best<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;With any sleight of hand.</p>

<p><i>4th Torturer.</i> Go we to the other ende<br />
Fellows, fasten fast your hende,<sup><a href="#fn_294" id="fna_294">294</a></sup><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And pull well at the band.</p>

That we draw now all together,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And look how it will fare.</p>

And draw we ilka syn from syn.<sup><a href="#fn_295" id="fna_295">295</a></sup><br />

We no longer draw one way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;So mickle have I espied.</p>

<p><i>4th Torturer.</i> No, for as I have bliss<br />
Some can twig whoso it is<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeks his ease on his own side.</p>

<p><i>1st Torturer.</i> It is better, as I hope<br />
Each by himself to draw this rope,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then may we see<br />
Who it is that erewhile<br />
All his fellows can beguile<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this company.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;How draw I?--as might thou the!<sup><a href="#fn_296" id="fna_296">296</a></sup></p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Enter Mary Magdalene, and Mary, mother of James.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Mary Magdalene.</i> What shall I do, alas!<br />
My Lord went to the tomb,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day is the third day;<br />
Go now see indeed<br />
If he comes and rises,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;As he said to me truly.</p>

<p><i>Mary, Mother of James.</i> I will go and see<br />
The body <i>of him</i> who redeemed me with pain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;If it be risen again.<br />
Great comfort he was to us;<br />
That we should have seen his death!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! alas!</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Enter Mary Salome</i></p>

<p><i>Mary Salome.</i> The third day is to-day;<br />
If the body of Christ be risen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to see.<br />
For the torment which he had<br />
Is ever in my heart;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;This sorrow does not leave me.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Here she shall meet the other Maries.</i></p>

<p><i>Mary Magdalene.</i> Women, joy to ye!<br />
And Mary, <i>mother</i> of James,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Salome also.<br />
Sorrow is in my heart, alas!<br />
If the body of God himself is gone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where may it be found?</p>

<p><i>Mary, Mother of James.</i> So it is with me,<br />
Much and great torment for him;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;If he will not, through his grace,<br />
Help me in a short time,<br />
My heart in me will break<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Very really through troubles.</p>

<p><i>Mary Salome.</i> So with me is sorrow<br />
May the Lord see my state<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;After him.<br />
As he is head of sovereignty,<br />
I believe that out of the tomb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day he will rise.</p>

<p><i>Mary Magdalene.</i> Oh! let us hasten at once,<br />
For the stone is raised<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;From the tomb.<br />
Lord, how will it be this night,<br />
If I know not where goes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of royalty?</p>

<p><i>Mary, Mother of James.</i> And too long we have stayed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lord is gone his way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the tomb, surely.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! my heart is sick;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know not indeed if I shall see him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is very God.</p>

<p><i>Mary Salome.</i> I know truly, and I believe it,<br />
That he is risen up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In this day.<br />
How will it be to us now,<br />
That we find not our Lord?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! woe! woe!</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>They sing.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Alas! mourning I sing, mourning I call,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Lord is dead that bought us all.</i></p>

<p><i>Mary Magdalene.</i> Alas! it is through sorrows,<br />
My sweet Lord is dead<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was crucified.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Mary Magdalene weeps at the tomb.</i></p>

<p>He bore, without complaining,<br />
Much pain on his dear body,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the people of the world<br />
<i>Mary, Mother of James.</i> I cannot see the form<br />
Of him on any side;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! woe is me!<br />
I would like to speak with him,<br />
If it were his will,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Very seriously.</p>

<p><i>Mary Salome.</i> There is to me sharp longing<br />
In my heart always,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sorrow;<br />
Alas! my Lord Jesus,<br />
For thou art full of virtue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;All mighty.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>The Dirge.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Alas! mourning I sing, mourning I call,<br />
Our Lord is dead that bought us all.</i></p>

<p><i>Mary Magdalene.</i> Jesus Christ, Lord of Heaven,<br />
O hear now our voice;<br />
Who believes not in thee, miserable he!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;He will not be saved.<br />
When I think of his Passion,<br />
There is not any joy in my heart;<br />
Alas! that I cannot at once<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak to thee.</p>

<p><i>Mary, Mother of James.</i> Gone he is to another land,<br />
And with him many angels;<br />
Alas! now for grief<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorrowful.<br />
I pray thee, Lord of grace,<br />
To send a messenger to us,<br />
That something we may be knowing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;How it is to thee.</p>

<p><i>Mary Salome.</i> O Jesus, full of mercy,<br />
Do think of us;<br />
To thy kingdom when we come,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear our voice.<br />
For desire I become very sick,<br />
I cannot stand on my standing,<br />
Alas! now what shall I do?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;O Lord of heaven!</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>The Dirge.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Alas! mourning I sing, mourning I call,<br />
Our Lord is dead, that bought us all.</i></p>

<p><i>1st Angel.</i> I know whom ye seek:<br />
Jesus is not here,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For he is risen<br />
To life in very earnest,<br />
As I tell you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like as he is worthy.</p>

<p><i>Mary Magdalene.</i> O angel, now tell me,<br />
The body (none, equal to him),<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To what place is it gone?<br />
Like as his grace is great,<br />
Joy to me, with my eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To see him yet.</p>

<p><i>2nd Angel.</i> O Mary, go forthwith,<br />
Say to his disciples<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And to Peter,<br />
Like as he promised to them<br />
He will go to Galilee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Very truly without doubt.</p>

<p><i>Mary, Mother of James.</i> Now he is risen again indeed,<br />
Jesus our Saviour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone from the tomb.<br />
Worship to him always;<br />
He is Lord of heaven and earth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Head of sovereignty.</p>

<p><i>Mary Salome.</i> Hence go we to the city,<br />
And let us say in every place<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have seen:<br />
That Jesus is risen,<br />
And from the tomb forth gone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To heaven really.</p>

<p><i>Mary Magdalene.</i> Never to the city shall I go,<br />
If I do find not my Lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was on the cross tree.<br />
O Jesus, King of grace,<br />
&nbsp;Joy to me once to see thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Amen, amen.</p>

<p><i>Mary, Mother of James.</i> Mary, be with thee<br />
All the blessings of women,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the blessing of Jesus Son of grace;<br />
Of full heart I pray him,<br />
Joy and grace always good to do<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To us now, from God the Father.</p>

<p><i>Mary Magdalene.</i> My blessing on ye also,<br />
From Christ, as he is gone to the tomb,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy to ye to do well to-day.<br />
Lord, give me the grace<br />
Once to see thy face,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;If it be thy will with thee.</p>

<p><i>Mary Salome.</i> Amen, amen, let us seek<br />
Christ, who redeemed us in pain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;With his flesh and with his blood;<br />
Much pain he suffered,<br />
For love of the people of the world,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;As he is the King of power.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Here Mary, the mother of James, and Salome retire from the tomb, and
sit down a little way from it.</i></p>

<p><i>Mary Magdalene.</i> He who made heaven, &middot; as he is gone to the tomb,<br />
After him &middot; great is my desire.<br />
Christ, hear my voice, &middot; I pray also<br />
That thou be with me &middot; at my end.</p>

<p>Lord Jesus, &middot; give me the grace,<br />
As I may be worthy &middot; to find a meeting,<br />
With thee to-day, &middot; in some sure place,<br />
That I may have a view &middot; and sight of thy face.</p>

<p>As thou art Creator &middot; of heaven and earth,<br />
And a Redeemer &middot; to us always,<br />
Christ my Saviour, &middot; hear, if it regards thee<br />
Disclose to me, &middot; what I so much desire.</p>

<p>Through great longing &middot; I am quite weary,<br />
And my body also, &middot; bones and back.<br />
Where is there to-night &middot; any man who knows<br />
Where I may yet find &middot; Christ full of sorrow.</p>

<h3>THE MYSTERY OF MARY MAGDALENE AND THE APOSTLES</h3>


<p class="stagedir">[<i>Now Mary comes to the apostles, and says to them in Galilee:</i></p>

<p><i>Mary Magdalene.</i> Now, O apostles,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I will tell you news:<br />
Jesus is risen from the tomb;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw him lately,<br />
I spoke to him also,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked on his wounds,<br />
Pitiful it was to see them;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the world they bring healing.</p>

<p><i>Thomas.</i> Silence, woman, with thy tales,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And speak truth, as I pray thee;<br />
Christ who was cruelly slain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To be alive I will not believe;<br />
Waste no more words,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For lies I do not love;<br />
Our Lord is dead;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! I tell the truth.</p>

<p><i>Mary Magdalene.</i> I speak true, Thomas,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I, though poor, will prove it.<br />
Lately I saw him,--<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord (none equal to him),<br />
And by me he sent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I swear to ye, as ye may know,<br />
Like as he promised;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;He named to me none but Peter.</p>

<p><i>Thomas.</i> Silence, and speak not, woman!<br />
I pray thee, mockery with us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now do not make;<br />
Stout though Castle Maudlen be,<br />
If thou mock, I will break thy head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;About thee from above.</p>

<p><i>Mary Magdalene.</i> I will not be silent from fear<br />
I will prove it true what I say<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before <i>we</i> separate.<br />
Like as he is King of heaven,<br />
He is with God the Father,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;On his right side.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> Ah! Jesus Christ, happy am I<br />
To hear that he is risen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the tomb;<br />
For I know very well<br />
That he is son to Mary,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And God likewise.</p>

<p><i>Thomas.</i> Peter, peace, and leave thy mockery,<br />
For idle it is to say<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;That he is risen.<br />
Never can, for the world,<br />
Any man be raised<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;After dying.</p>

<p><i>James the Greater.</i> Thomas, very well it may be;<br />
The Son of God will rise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;When he will;<br />
For Jesus, Son of Mary,<br />
He made heaven, and this world,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And every thing that was not.</p>

<p><i>Thomas.</i> O James, it is no use for thee;<br />
A man who is dead certainly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Does not live again.<br />
Foolish idleness, not to leave it,<br />
But to go to assert<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;A thing of no benefit.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> O Thomas, thou art a fool;<br />
That is the belief of all:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus Christ after dying,<br />
To be put into the ground;<br />
After that to rise again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of three days, and to stand up.</p>

<p><i>Thomas.</i> O John, be not absurd,<br />
For my wonder,--it is great,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;That thou shouldst speak folly.<br />
Christ through sufferings was<br />
Indeed put to death on the cross tree;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;My curse on him that did it!</p>

<p><i>Bartholomew.</i> Thomas, believe me, though I am gray;<br />
Man could not have power<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To put him to death.<br />
For us he would die,<br />
And go into the tomb, and rise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To carry all Christians to heaven.</p>

<p><i>Thomas.</i> O Bartte, thou art mad<br />
And fond beyond all men<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are fools.<br />
God, without dying, might have<br />
Caused all men to be saved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Over all the world.</p>

<p><i>Matthew.</i> That is true, he could<br />
Destroy every thing again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;That it be no more.<br />
But nevertheless for us,<br />
Christ wished to go into the ground,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And to live again.</p>

<p><i>Thomas.</i> And thou art a fool, Matthew;<br />
If thou art wise thou wilt be silent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And withdraw.<br />
He lives not, through all thy words,<br />
When I saw him, he was dead<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;On the cross tree.</p>

<p><i>Philip.</i> Alas! to be so foolish!<br />
Crooked, wilt thou not believe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Head of sovereignty;<br />
And he saying to us<br />
That after dying he would rise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the tomb?</p>

<p><i>Thomas.</i> Sit silent, wilt thou, Philip,<br />
For in faith thou swearest wrongly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;About him.<br />
Christ's limbs were bruised,<br />
And on his body a thousand wounds;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! he is not risen.</p>

<p><i>James the Greater.</i> O do not say so,<br />
That Jesus the best Lord<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot rise,<br />
For very truly he is risen;<br />
To be his servant thou art not worthy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears well.</p>

<p><i>Thomas.</i> O thou James, if he were alive<br />
His servant I would be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Very joyfully.<br />
But he is not alive, leave off thy noise;<br />
The thorn even into his brain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Went to his head.</p>

<p><i>Simon.</i> Though the thorn went into his head,<br />
And through his heart and side<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The spear was seen,<br />
Nevertheless need is to believe<br />
Jesus Christ will rise again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;As he is true God.</p>

<p><i>Thomas.</i> O Simon, do not speak a word;<br />
Never, never, unhappily,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;He has not risen again.<br />
But if it were so,<br />
Together we should all be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceedingly at ease.</p>

<p><i>Judah.</i> Sir Thomas, it is so,<br />
He has risen again to-day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the tomb.<br />
For if he should not rise again,<br />
Never with us would there be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy without end.</p>

<p><i>Thomas.</i> O Judah, Judah, leave thy belief;<br />
His heart torn in pieces<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw.<br />
Notwithstanding what any man may say,<br />
That same body will remain;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;It has not risen.</p>

<p><i>Andrew.</i> Peace, Thomas, and say not a word;<br />
Very truly our dear Lord<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is risen again.<br />
Surely too much thou hast disbelieved,<br />
For Mary has spoken<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;With him to-day.</p>

<p><i>Thomas.</i> Thou art a fool, Andrew;<br />
The girl has told a lie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not think otherwise.<br />
That he ever rose again<br />
I will not believe it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as I am alive.</p>

<p><i>Mary Magdalene.</i> I have not said an untrue word;<br />
For to me all his wounds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;He shewed.<br />
And to that I will<br />
Bear witness at all times,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;That the tale is true.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Here let Thomas and Mary Magdalene go down.</i></p>

<p><i>Thomas.</i> Notwithstanding vain words,<br />
I do not believe thee; thou failest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To make me believe.<br />
Though thou dost chatter so much,<br />
Any thing from thee regards me not,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though thou be busy.</p>

<p><i>Mary Magdalene.</i> I tell thee the truth;<br />
&nbsp;The angel said to us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely at the tomb,<br />
That he was risen up,<br />
And was gone to the bright heaven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;With many angels.</p>

<p><i>Thomas.</i> Peace, chattering woman, say no more;<br />
I will not believe thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>That</i> is gone to heaven.<br />
The body, which I saw dead,--<br />
Great are my anxieties<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;After it.</p>

<p><i>Mary Magdalene.</i> Surely Mary, mother of James,<br />
And Mary Salome,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will witness to me;<br />
Like as I saw,<br />
So I tell the tale to thee;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Do believe it.</p>

<p><i>Thomas.</i> Never can it go into my heart,<br />
That the body dead before us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should rise again;<br />
When I think on his passion,<br />
Grief takes me immediately<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, woe is me!</p>

<p><i>Mary Magdalene.</i> There is to me wonder of thee,<br />
That thy heart is so hard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou believest it not.<br />
If thou doest not believe it,<br />
Never shalt thou come to the joy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely which is in heaven.</p>

<p><i>Thomas.</i> Silence thou, now, for shame;<br />
With Jesus thou hast no secrets:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely not! I believe<br />
Thou art a sinner, without a mistake;<br />
The greatest that was in the country<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;By every body thou wast called.</p>

<p><i>Mary Magdalene.</i> I have been a sinner;<br />
I have sinned wondrous much;<br />
On Jesus I cried,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;That he would forgive me my trespass;<br />
And he said to me,<br />
Thy sin is forgiven to thee,<br />
Through thy faith thou art saved:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now no more, do not sin.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas, thou art very stupid,<br />
Because thou wilt not believe<br />
The Lord to have risen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Easter-day morning.<br />
Who believes not shall not be saved,<br />
Nor with God shall he dwell,<br />
And for that, I pray thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Believe in time.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Thomas.</i> Hold thy prate, nor be busy,<br />
For I will not believe thee;<br />
The body was seen by me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fastened on the cross with nails;<br />
With a sharp spear they pierced him,<br />
So that it passed through the heart;<br />
To the earth the blood fell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And made him soon dead.<br />
That body cannot live,<br />
Nor rise up again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, thou woman.<br />
There is not any man of this world<br />
Who shall make me now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Believe otherwise.</p>

<p><i>Mary Magdalene.</i> Thomas, thou art mad,<br />
And in madness lost;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Evil it is with me now.<br />
I advise thee believe,<br />
And if thou dost not, seriously,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shalt have sharp repentance.</p>

<p><i>Thomas.</i> With you since there is no peace,<br />
From you I will go<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;My ways in the country.<br />
Are ye not now fools?<br />
So God help me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I love not lies.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Then Jesus comes to the apostles, and says (in Galilee, the doors

I, Christ, to rise from the tomb,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Believe well;<br />
For certainly as many as believe it,<br />
And are faithfully baptized,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall be saved.</p>

<p><i>Peter.</i> O dear Lord, happy is my lot<br />
To see thee risen again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus, though I denied thee.<br />
Abundant mercy, I pray,<br />
As the Jews are always<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here laying snares for us.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus, Lord of heaven and earth,<br />
And Saviour to us also,<br />
Pardon me my trespass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For great are my sorrows.<br />
For sharp repentance falls on me<br />
For denying thee: now<br />
Mercy I pray at all times,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, with full heart.</p>

<p><i>Jesus.</i> Peter, pardon thou shalt get,<br />
For thy repentance is perfect,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the Holy Ghost.<br />
Like as I redeemed thee dearly,<br />
Strengthen also thy brethren<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In full belief.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> O Lord, I am glad<br />
That thou wouldst come with us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hither, for our joy;<br />
That I will say likewise,<br />
We are, through great longing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;After thee pining.</p>

<p><i>Jesus.</i> From you I go to my country;<br />
At the right side of God the Father,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall sit.<br />
To strengthen you in belief,<br />
To you the comfort of the Holy Ghost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall send.</p>

<p><i>James the Greater.</i> Lord, it is wonderful;<br />
When thou comest, Jesus powerful,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To look at us,<br />
And to speak peace to us,<br />
Though they were fast, thou didst open<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our doors.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Here Jesus goes away from the apostles.</i></p>

<p>He is the Lord of power,<br />

A day is coming that shall tell<br />

<h3>GOD'S PROMISES</h3>


<p><i>A Tragedy or interlude manifesting the chief promises of God unto man
by all ages in the old law, from the Fall of Adam to the Incarnation of
the Lord Jesus Christ. Compiled by John Bale, (Anno Domini MDXXXVIII.).</i></p>


<p><i>Baleus Prolocutor.</i> If profit may grow, most Christian audience,<br />
By knowledge of things which are but transitory,<br />
And here for a time, of much more congruence,<br />
Advantage might spring, by the search of causes heavenly,<br />
As those matters are that the gospel specify.<br />
Without whose knowledge no man to the truth can fall,<br />
Nor ever attain to the life perpetual,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For he that knoweth not the living God eternal<br />
The Father, the Son and also the Holy Ghost,<br />
And what Christ suffered for redemption of us all,<br />
What he commanded, and taught in every coast,<br />
And what he forbode, that man must needs be lost,<br />
And clean secluded, from the faithful chosen sort,<br />
In the Heavens above, to his most high discomfort.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;You therefore, good friends, I lovingly exhort,<br />
To weigh such matters as will be uttered here,<br />
Of whom ye may look to have no trifling sport<br />
In fantasies feigned, nor such-like gaudy gear,<br />
But the things that shall your inward stomach cheer.<br />
To rejoice in God for your justification,<br />
And alone in Christ to hope for your salvation.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea first ye shall have the eternal generation<br />
Of Christ, like as John in his first chapter write,<br />
And consequently of man the first creation<br />
The abuse and fall, through his first oversight,<br />
And the rise-again through God's high grace and might;<br />
By promises first which shall be declared all:<br />
Then by his own Son, the worker principal.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Adam bewaileth here his fall;<br />
God will shew mercy to every generation,<br />
And to his kingdom of his great goodness call<br />
His elected spouse, or faithful congregation,<br />
As shall appear by open protestation,<br />
Which from Christ's birth shall to his death conclude:<br />
They come, that thereof will shew the certitude.</p>



<p>ACT I</p>

<p>ADAM THE FIRST MAN</p>


<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> In the beginning before the heavens were create,<br />
In me and of me was my Son sempiternal<br />
With the Holy Ghost, in one degree or estate<br />
Of the high Godhead, to me the Father coequal<br />
And this my Son was with me one God essential<br />
Without separation at any time from me.<br />
True God he is of equal dignity.<br />
Since the beginning my Son hath ever been<br />
Joined with his father in one essential being.<br />
All things were create by him in each degree,<br />
In heaven and earth and have their diverse working:<br />
Without his power, was never made any thing<br />
That was wrought; but through his ordinance<br />
Each have his strength, and whole continuance.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In him is the life and the just recoverance<br />
For Adam and his, which nought but death deserved.<br />
And this life to men is an high perseverance<br />
Or a light of faith, whereby they shall be saved.<br />
And this light shall shine among the people darkened<br />
With unfaithfulness. Yet shall they not with him take<br />
But of wilful heart his liberal grace forsake.<br />
Which will compel me against man for to make<br />
In my displeasure, and send plagues of correction<br />
Most grievous and sharp, his wanton lusts to slake,<br />
By water and fire, by sickness and infection<br />
Of pestilent sores, molesting his complexion;<br />
By troublous war, by dearth and painful scarceness,<br />
And after this life by an extreme heaviness.<br />
I will first begin with Adam for his lewdness<br />
Which for an apple neglected my commandment.<br />
He shall continue in labour for his rashness,<br />
His only sweat shall provide his food and raiment:<br />
Yea, yet must he have a greater punishment,<br />
Most terrible death shall bring him to his end<br />
To teach him how he his Lord God shall offend.</p>

<p>NOAH THE JUST</p>


<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> I have been moved to strike man diversely,<br />
Since I left Adam in this same earthly mansion;<br />
For why? He hath done to me displeasures many,<br />
And will not amend his life in any condition:<br />
No respect hath he to my word nor monition,<br />
But what doth him lust, without discreet advisement,<br />
And will in nowise take mine advertisement.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cain hath slain Abel, his brother, an innocent,<br />
Whose blood from the earth doth call to me for vengeance:<br />
My children with men's so carnally consent,<br />
That their vain working is unto me much grievance:<br />
Mankind is but flesh in his whole dalliance.<br />
All vice increaseth in him continually,<br />
Nothing he regardeth to walk unto my glory.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart abhorreth his wilful misery,<br />
His cancred malice, his cursed covetousness,<br />
His lusts lecherous, his vengeable tyranny,<br />
Unmerciful murder and other ungodliness.<br />
I will destroy him for his outrageousness,<br />
And not him only, but all that on earth do stir,<br />
For it repenteth me that ever I made them here.</p>

<p><i>Noah.</i> Most gentle Maker, with his frailness somewhat bear,<br />
Man is thy creature, thyself cannot say nay.<br />
Though thou punish him to put him somewhat in fear,<br />
His fault to acknowledge, yet seek not his decay.<br />
Thou mayest reclaim him, though he goeth now astray,<br />
And bring him again, of thy abundant grace,<br />
To the fold of faith, he acknowledging his trespass.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> Thou knowest I have given to him convenient space,<br />
With lawful warnings, yet he amendeth in no place.<br />
The natural laws, which I wrote in his heart,<br />
He hath outraced, all goodness putting apart:<br />
Of health the covenant, which I to Adam made,<br />
He regardeth not, but walketh a damnable trade.</p>

<p><i>Noah.</i> All this is true, Lord, I cannot thy words reprove,<br />
Let his weakness yet thy merciful goodness move.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> No weakness is it, but wilful working all,<br />
That reigneth in man through mind diabolical.<br />
He shall have therefore like as he hath deserved.</p>

<p><i>Noah.</i> Lose him not yet, Lord, though he has deeply swerved.<br />
I know thy mercy is far above his rudeness,<br />
Being infinite, as all other things are in thee.<br />
His folly therefore now pardon of thy goodness,<br />
And measure it not beyond thy godly pity.<br />
Esteem not his fault farther than help may be,<br />
But grant him thy grace, as he offendeth so deeply,<br />
Thee to remember, and abhor his misery.<br />
Of all goodness, Lord, remember thy great mercy,<br />
To Adam and Eve, breaking thy first commandment.<br />
Them thou relievedst with thy sweet promise heavenly,<br />
Sinful though they were, and their lives negligent.<br />
I know that mercy with thee is permanent,<br />
And will be ever so long as the world endure:<br />
Then close not thy hand from man, which is thy creature.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Being thy subject he is underneath thy cure,<br />
Correct him thou mayest and so bring him to grace.<br />
All lieth in thy hands, to leave or to allure,<br />
Bitter death to give, or grant most sovereign solace.<br />
Utterly from man avert not then thy face;<br />
But let him savour thy sweet benevolence<br />
Somewhat, though he feel thy hand for his offence.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> My true servant Noah, thy righteousness doth move me<br />
Somewhat to reserve for man's posterity.<br />
Though I drown the world, yet will I save the lives<br />
Of thee and thy wife, thy three sons and their wives,<br />
And of each kind two, to maintain you hereafter.</p>

<p><i>Noah.</i> Blessed be thy name, most mighty merciful Maker,<br />
With thee to dispute, it were inconvenient.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> Why dost thou say so? Be bold to speak thy intent.</p>

<p><i>Noah.</i> Shall the other die without any remedy?</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> I will drown them all, for their wilful wicked folly<br />
That man hereafter thereby may know my power,<br />
And fear to offend my goodness day and hour.</p>

<p><i>Noah.</i> As thy pleasure is, so might it always be,<br />
For my health thou art and soul's felicity.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> After that this flood have had his raging passage<br />
This shall be to thee my covenant everlasting.<br />
The seas and waters so far never more shall rage,<br />
As all flesh to drown, I will so temper their working;<br />
This sign will I add also, to confirm the thing,<br />
In the clouds above, as a seal or token clear,<br />
For safeguard of man, my rainbow shall appear.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Take thou this covenant for an earnest confirmation<br />
Of my former promise to Adam's generation.</p>

<p><i>Noah.</i> I will, blessed Lord, with my whole heart and mind.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> Farewell then, just Noah, here leave I thee behind,</p>

<p><i>Noah.</i> Most mighty Maker, ere I from hence depart,<br />
I must give thee praise from the bottom of my heart.<br />
Whom may we thank, Lord, for our health and salvation<br />
But thy great mercy and goodness undeserved?<br />
Thy promise, in faith, is our justification,<br />
As it was Adam's when his heart therein rested,<br />
And as it was theirs which therein also trusted.<br />
This faith was grounded in Adam's memory,<br />
And clearly declared in Abel's innocency.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Faith in that promise old Adam did justify,<br />
In that promise faith made Eve to prophecy.<br />
Faith in that promise proved Abel innocent,<br />
In that promise faith made Seth full obedient.<br />
That faith taught Enoch on God's name first to call,<br />
And made Methuselah the oldest man of all.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;That faith brought Enoch to so high exercise,<br />
That God took him up with him into Paradise.<br />
Of that faith the want made Cain to hate the good,<br />
And all his offspring to perish in the flood.<br />
Faith in that promise preserved both me and mine:<br />
So will it all them which follow the same line.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only this gift thou hast given me, sweet Lord,<br />
But with it also thine everlasting covenant<br />
Of trust forever, thy rainbow bearing record,<br />
Never more to drown the world by flood inconstant;<br />
Alack! I cannot to thee give praise condign,<br />
Yet will I sing here with heart meek and benign.</p>

<p>ACT III</p>

<p>OF FAITHFUL ABRAHAM</p>


<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> Mine high displeasure must needs return to man,<br />
Considering the sin that he doth day by day;<br />
For neither kindness nor extreme handling can<br />
Make him to know me by any faithful way,<br />
But still in mischief he walketh to his decay.<br />
If he do not soon his wickedness consider,<br />
He is like, doubtless, to perish altogether.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In my sight, he is more venym<sup><a href="#fn_611" id="fna_611">611</a></sup> than the spider,<br />
Through such abuses as he hath exercised,<br />
From the time of Noah to this same season hither.<br />
An uncomely act without shame Ham commysed.<sup><a href="#fn_612" id="fna_612">612</a></sup><br />

In like case Nimrod against me wrought abusion<br />
As he raised up the castle of confusion.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mirus hath also, and all by the devil's illusion<br />
Through image-making, up raised idolatry,<br />
Me to dishonour. And now in the conclusion<br />
The vile Sodomites live so unnaturally<br />
That their sin vengeance asketh continually,<br />
For my covenant's sake, I will not drown with water,<br />
Yet shall I visit their sins with other matter.</p>

<p><i>Abraham.</i> Yet, merciful Lord, thy graciousness remember<br />
To Adam and Noah, both in thy word and promise:<br />

My hope is, all flesh shall not perish in thy sight.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> No truly, Abraham, thou chancest upon the right,<br />
The thing I shall do I will not hide from thee,<br />
Whom I have blessed for thy true fidelity:<br />
For I know thou wilt cause both thy children and servants,<br />
In my ways to walk, and trust unto my covenants,<br />
That I may perform with thee my earnest promise.</p>

<p><i>Abraham.</i> All that I will do, by assistance of thy goodness.</p>

For my great vengeance, which will upon them fall,<br />
Wild fire and brimstone shall light upon them all.</p>

<p><i>Abraham.</i> Pitiful Maker, though they have kindled thy fury,<br />
Cast not away yet the just sort with the ungodly.<br />
Peradventure there may be fifty righteous persons<br />
Within those cities, wilt thou lose them all at once,<br />
And not spare the place for those fifty righteous' sake<br />
Be it far from thee such rigour to undertake.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope there is not in thee so cruel hardness,<br />
As to cast away the just men with the reckless,<br />
And so to destroy the good with the ungodly:<br />
In the judge of all: be never such a fury.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> At Sodom, if I may find just persons fifty,<br />
The place will I spare for their sakes verily.</p>

More than becomes me, lord, pardon my negligence:<br />
I am but ashes and were loth thee to offend.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> Say forth, good Abraham, for ill dost thou not intend.</p>

<p><i>Abraham.</i> Haply there may be five less in the same number,<br />
For thy sake I hope thou wilt not the rest accombre.<sup><a href="#fn_613" id="fna_613">613</a></sup></p>

<p><i>Abraham.</i> What if the city may forty righteous make?</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> Then will I pardon it for those same forty's sake.</p>

<p><i>Abraham.</i> Be not angry, Lord, though I speak undiscreetly.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> Utter thy whole mind and spare me not hardly.</p>

<p><i>Abraham.</i> Peradventure there may be thirty found among them.</p>

<p><i>Abraham.</i> I take upon me too much, Lord, in thy sight.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> No, no, good Abraham, for I know thy faith is right.</p>

<p><i>Abraham.</i> No less, I suppose, than twenty can it have.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> Could I find twenty, that city would I save.</p>

<p><i>Abraham.</i> Once yet will I speak my mind, and then no more.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> Spare not to utter so much as thou hast in store.</p>

<p><i>Abraham.</i> And what if there might be ten good creatures found?</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> The rest for their sakes might so be safe and sound,<br />
And not destroyed for their abomination.</p>

<p><i>Abraham.</i> O merciful Maker, much is thy toleration<br />
And sufferance of sin: I see it now indeed;<br />
Vouchsafe yet of favour out of those cities to lead<br />
Those that be faithful, though their flock be but small.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> Lot and his household, I will deliver all,<br />
For righteousness sake, which is of me and not them.</p>

<p><i>Abraham.</i> Great are thy graces in the generation of Shem.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> Well, Abraham, well, for thy true faithfulness<br />
Now will I give thee my covenant or third promise.<br />
Look thou believe it as thou covetest righteousness.</p>

All generations in thy seed shall be blessed:<br />
As the stars of heaven, so shall thy kindred be;<br />
And by the same seed the world shall be redressed<br />
In circumcision shall this thing be expressed,<br />
As in a sure seal, to prove my promise true,<br />
Print this in thy faith, and it shall thy soul renew.</p>

<p><i>Abraham.</i> I will not one jot, Lord, from thy will dissent<br />
But to thy pleasure be always obedient,<br />
Thy laws to fulfil, and most precious commandment.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> Farewell, Abraham, for here in place I leave<br />
thee.</p>

<p><i>Abraham.</i> Thanks will I render, like as it shall behove me.<br />
Everlasting praise to thy most glorious name,<br />
Which savedst Adam through faith in thy sweet promise<br />
Of the woman's seed, and now confirmest the same<br />
In the seed of me. Forsooth great is thy goodness.<br />
I cannot perceive but that thy mercy is endless.<br />
To such as fear thee, in every generation,<br />
For it endureth without abbreviation.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;This have I printed in deep consideration,<br />
No worldly matter can rase it out of mind.<br />
For once it will be the final restoration<br />
Of Adam and Eve, and other that hath sinned;<br />
Yea, the sure health and race of mankind.<br />
Help have the faithful thereof, though they be infect;<br />
They, condemnation, where as it is reject.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Merciful Maker, my crabbed voice direct,<br />
That it may break out in some sweet praise to thee;<br />
And suffer me not thy due lauds to neglect,<br />
But let me show forth thy commendations free.<br />

<p><i>Moses.</i> Thy eternal will evermore fulfilled be.<br />
For disobedience thou slewest the sons of Aaron,<br />
The earth swallowed in both Dathan and Abiron.<br />
The adders did sting other wicked persons else,<br />
In wonderful number. Thus hast thou punished rebels.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> Never will I spare the cursed iniquity.<br />
Of idolatry, for no cause, thou mayst trust me.</p>

<p><i>Moses.</i> Forgive them yet, Lord, for this time, if it may be.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> Thinkest thou that I will so soon change my decree?<br />
No, no, friend Moses, so light thou shalt not find me.<br />
I will punish them all; Israel shall it see.</p>

<p><i>Moses.</i> I know, thy people have wrought abomination,<br />
Worshipping false gods, to thy honour's derogation,<br />
Yet mercifully thou mayest upon them look;<br />
And if thou wilt not, thrust me out of thy book.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> Those great blasphemers shall out of my book clean,<br />
But thou shalt not so, for I know what thou dost mean.<br />
Conduct my people, mine angel shall assist thee,<br />
That sin in a day will not uncorrected be.<br />
And for the true zeal that thou to my people hast,<br />
I add this covenant unto my promises past.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Raise them up I will a prophet from among them,<br />
Not unlike to thee, to speak my words unto them.<br />
Whoso heareth not that he shall speak in my name,<br />
I will revenge it to his perpetual shame.<br />
The passover lamb will be a token just<br />
Of this strong covenant. This have I clearly discussed,<br />
In my appointment this hour for your deliverance.</p>

<p><i>Moses.</i> Never shall this thing depart from my remembrance.<br />
Praise be for ever to thee, most merciful Lord,<br />
Who never withdrawest from man thy heavenly comfort,<br />
But from age to age thy benefits do record<br />
What thy goodness is, and hath been to his sort.<br />
As we find thy grace, so ought we to report.<br />
And doubtless it is to us most bounteous,<br />
Yea, for all our sins most ripe and plenteous.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Abraham our father found thee benevolous,<sup><a href="#fn_616" id="fna_616">616</a></sup><br />
So did good Isaac in his distress among.<br />
To Jacob thou wert a guide most gracious.<br />
Joseph thou savedst from dangerous deadly wrong,<br />
Melchisedec and Job felt thy great goodness strong,<br />
So did good Sarah, Rebecca, and fair Rachel,<br />
With Zephorah my wife, the daughter of Raguel.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To praise thee, sweet Lord, my faith doth me compel,<br />
For thy covenant's sake wherein rests our salvation,<br />
The seed of promise, all other seeds excel,<br />
For therein remaineth our full justification.<br />
From Adam to Noah, in Abraham's generation,<br />
That seed procureth God's mighty grace and power;<br />
For the same seed's sake, I will sing now this hour.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Then he begins to sing an antiphon in a clear voice, "O Emmanuel,"

<p>ACT V</p>

<p>OF PIUS KING DAVID</p>


<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> For all the favour I have shewed Israel,<br />
Delivering it from Pharaoh's tyranny,<br />
And giving the land, <i>fluentem lac et mel</i>,<sup><a href="#fn_617" id="fna_617">617</a></sup><br />
Yet will it not leave its old idolatry,<br />
Nor know me for God. I abhor its misery.<br />
Vexed it I have with battles and decays,<br />
Still must I plague it, I see no other ways.</p>

<p><i>David.</i> Remember yet, Lord, thy worthy servant Moses,<br />
Walking in thy sight, without rebuke of thee.<br />
Both Aaron, Jethro, Eleazar, and Phinees,<sup><a href="#fn_618" id="fna_618">618</a></sup><br />
Evermore feared to offend thy majesty,<br />
Much thou acceptedst thy servant Josue.<sup><a href="#fn_619" id="fna_619">619</a></sup><br />
Caleb and Othniel sought thee with all their heart,<br />
Aioth and Sangar for thy folk did their part.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gideon and Tholus thy enemies put to smart,<br />
Jair and Jephtha gave praises to thy name.<br />
These, to leave idols, thy people did court.<br />
Samson the strongest, for his part did the same.<br />
Samuel and Nathan thy messages did proclaim.<br />
What though fierce Pharaoh wrought mischief in thy sight,<br />
He was a pagan, lay not that in our light.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the Benjamites abused the ways of right,<br />
So did Eli's sons, and the sons of Samuel.<br />
Saul in his office was slothful day and night,<br />
Wicked was Shimei, so was Ahitophel.<br />
Measure not by them the faults of Israel,<br />
Whom thou hast loved of long time so entirely,<br />
But of thy great grace remit its wicked folly.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> I cannot abide the vice of idolatry,<br />
Though I should suffer all other villany.<br />
When Joshua was dead, that sort from me did fall<br />
To the worshipping of Ashteroth and Baal,<br />
Full unclean idols, and monsters bestial.</p>

<p><i>David.</i> For it they have had thy righteous punishment,<br />
And forasmuch as they did wickedly consent<br />
To the Philistines and Canaanites ungodly<br />
Idolaters, taking to them in matrimony,<br />
Thou threwest them under the King of Mesopotamy,<br />
After thou subduedst them for their idolatry.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Eighteen years to Eglon, the King of Moabites,<br />
And twenty years to Jabin, the King of Canaanites,<br />
Oppressed they were seven years by the Midianites,<br />
And eighteen years vexed by the cruel Ammonites.<br />
In three great battles, of three score thousand and five,<br />
Of this thy people, not one was left alive.<br />
Have mercy now, Lord, and call them to repentance.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> So long as they sin, so long shall they have grievance.<br />
David my servant, something must I say to thee,<br />
For that thou lately hast wrought such vanity.</p>

<p><i>David.</i> Spare not, blessed Lord, but say thy pleasure to me.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> Of late days thou hast misused Bathsheba,<br />
The wife of Uriah, and slain him in the field.</p>

<p><i>David.</i> Mercy, Lord, mercy; for doubtless I am defiled.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> I constitute thee a king over Israel,<br />
And thee preserved from Saul, who was thine enemy.<br />
Yea, in my favour, so much thou didst excel,<br />
That of thine enemies I gave thee victory.<br />
Philistines and Syrians to thee came tributary.<br />
Why hast thou then wrought such folly in my sight.<br />
Despising my word, against all godly right?</p>

<p><i>David.</i> I have sinned, Lord, I beseech thee, pardon me,</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> Thou shalt not die, David, for this iniquity,<br />
For thy repentance; but thy son by Bathsheba<br />
Shall die, forasmuch as my name is blasphemed<br />
Among my enemies, and thou the worse esteemed.<br />
From thy house for this the sword shall not depart.</p>

<p><i>David.</i> I am sorry, Lord, from the bottom of my heart.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> To further anger thou dost me yet compel.</p>

<p><i>David.</i> For what matter, Lord? I beseech thy goodness tell.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> Why didst thou number the children of Israel?<br />
Supposest in thy mind therein thou hast done well?</p>

<p><i>David.</i> I cannot say nay, but I have done indiscreetly<br />
To forget thy grace for a human policy.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> Thou shalt of these three choose which plague thou wilt have,<br />
For that sinful act, that I thy soul may save.<br />
A scarceness seven years, or else three months' exile,<br />
If not, for three days a pestilence most vile,<br />
For one thou must have, there is no remedy.</p>

<p><i>David.</i> Lord, at thy pleasure, for thou art full of mercy.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> Of a pestilence then, three score thousand and ten,<br />
In three days shall die of thy most puissant men.</p>

<p><i>David.</i> O Lord, it is I who have offended thy grace,<br />
Spare them and not me, for I have done the trespace.<sup><a href="#fn_620" id="fna_620">620</a></sup></p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> Though thy sins be great, thine inward heart's contribution<br />
Doth move my stomach in wonderful condition.<br />
I find thee a man according to my heart;<br />
Wherefore this promise I make thee, ere I depart.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;A fruit there shall come forth issuing from thy body,<br />
Whom I will advance upon thy seat for ever.<br />
His throne shall become a seat of heavenly glory<br />
His worthy sceptre from right will not dissever,<br />
His happy kingdom, of faith shall perish never.<br />
Of heaven and of earth he was author principal,<br />
And will continue, though they do perish all.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;This sign shalt thou have for a token special,<br />
That thou mayst believe my words unfeignedly,<br />
Where thou hast minded, for my memorial,<br />
To build a temple, thou shalt not finish it truly;<br />
But Solomon thy son shall do that action worthy,<br />
In token that Christ must finish everything<br />
That I have begun, to my praise everlasting.</p>

<p><i>David.</i> Immortal glory to thee, most heavenly King,<br />
For that thou hast given continual victory<br />
To me thy servant, ever since my annointing,<br />
And also before, by many conquests worthy.<br />
A bear and lion I slew through thy strength only.<br />
I slew Goliath, who was six cubits long.<br />
Against thine enemies thou madest me ever strong.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;My fleshly frailness made me do deadly wrong,<br />
And clean to forget thy laws of righteousness.<br />
And though thou visitedst my sinfulness among,<br />
With pestilent plagues, and other unquietness;<br />
Yet never tookst thou from me thy plenteousness<br />
Of thy godly spir't, which thou in me didst plant.<br />
I having remorse, thy grace could never want.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For in conclusion, thy everlasting covenant<br />
Thou gavest unto me for all my wicked sin;<br />
And hast promised here by protestation constant,<br />
That one of my seed shall such high fortune win,<br />
As never did man since this world did begin.<br />
By his power he shall put Satan from his hold,<br />
In rejoice whereof to sing will I be bold.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Then he begins in a musical voice an antiphon, "O Adonai," which the
chorus (as before) follows with instruments.</i></p>

<p>O Lord God Adonai, and guide of the faithful house of Israel, who<br />

a law on Mount Sinai, come now to redeem us in the strength of thy right<br />

<p>ACT VI</p>

<p>OF THE PROPHET ESAIAS</p>


<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> I brought up children from their first infancy,<br />
Who now despise all my godly instructions.<br />
An ox knoweth its lord, an ass its master's duty,<br />
But Israel will not know me, nor my conditions.<br />
Oh, froward people, given all to superstitions,<br />
Unnatural children, expert in blasphemies,<br />
Provoke me into hate, by their idolatries.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Take heed to my words, ye tyrants of Sodoma,<br />
In vain ye offer your sacrifice to me.<br />
Discontent I am with you beasts of Gomorrah<br />
And have no pleasure when I your offerings see.<br />
I abhor your fasts and your solemnity,<br />
For your traditions my ways ye set apart,<br />
Your works are in vain, I hate them from the heart.</p>

<p><i>Esaias.</i> Thy city, sweet Lord, is now become unfaithful,<br />
And her conditions are turned upside down.<br />
Her life is unchaste, her acts be very hurtful,<br />
Her murder and theft have darkened her renown.<br />
Covetous rewards do so their conscience drown,<br />
That the fatherless they will not help to right,<br />
The poor widow's cause comes not before their sight.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy peaceable paths seek they neither day nor night;<br />
But walk wicked ways after their fantasy.<br />
Convert their hearts, Lord, and give them thy true light,<br />
That they may perceive their customable folly:<br />
Leave them not helpless in so deep misery,<br />
But call them from it of thy most special grace,<br />
By thy true prophets, to their souls' health and solace.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> First they had fathers, then had they patriarchs,<br />
Then dukes, then judges for their guides and monarchs:<br />
Now have they stout kings, yet are they wicked still,<br />
And will in no wise my pleasant laws fulfil.<br />
Always they apply to idols' worshipping,<br />
From the vile beggar to the annointed king.</p>

<p><i>Esaias.</i> For that cause thou hast in two divided them,<br />
In Samaria the one, the other in Jerusalem.<br />
The king of Judah in Jerusalem did dwell,<br />
And in Samaria the king of Israel.<br />
Ten of the twelve tribes became Samaritans,<br />
And the other two were Hierosolymitans.<sup><a href="#fn_621" id="fna_621">621</a></sup><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In both these countries, according to their doings,<br />
Thou permittedst them to have most cruel kings.<br />
The first of Judah was wicked king Roboam,<br />
Of Israel the first was that cruel Jeroboam;<br />
Abiah then followed, and in the other Nadab,<br />
Then Bassa, then Helah, then Zambri, Jehoram and Ahab.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Ochesius, then Athaliah, then Joas;<sup><a href="#fn_622" id="fna_622">622</a></sup><br />
On the other part was Jonathan and Achaz.<br />
To rehearse all them that have done wretchedly<br />
In the sight of thee, it were long verily.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> For the wicked sin of filthy idolatry,<br />
Which the ten tribes did in the land of Samarie,<br />
In space of one day fifty thousand men I slew,<br />
Three of their cities also I overthrew,<br />
And left the people in such captivity,<br />
That in all the world they knew not whither to flee.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two tribes, when they from me went back<br />
To idolatry, I left in the hand of Shishak,<br />
The king of Egypt, who took away their treasure,<br />
Conveyed their cattle, and slew them without measure.<br />
In time of Ahaz, a hundred thousand and twenty<br />
Were slain at one time for their idolatry.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hundred thousand from thence were captive led,<br />
Their goods dispersed, and they with penury fed.<br />
Seldom they fail it, but either the Egyptians<br />
Have them in bondage, or else the Assyrians.</p>

<p><i>Esaias.</i> Well, yet blessed Lord, relieve them with thy mercy.<br />
Though they have been ill other princes' days,<br />
Yet good Hezekiah hath taught them goodly ways.<br />
When the prince is good, the people are the better;<br />
And as he is nought, their vices are the greater.<br />
Heavenly Lord, therefore send them the consolation,<br />
Which thou hast covenanted with every generation.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Open thou the heavens, and let the lamb come hither,<br />
Who will deliver thy people altogether.<br />
Ye planets and clouds, cast down your dews and rain,<br />
That the earth may bear out healthful savour plain.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> May the wife forget the child of her own body?</p>

<p><i>Esaias.</i> Nay, that she can not in any wise verily.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> No more can I them who will do my commandments,<br />
But must preserve them from all inconvenience.</p>

<p><i>Esaias.</i> Blessed art thou, Lord, in all thy acts and judgments.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> Well, Esaias, for this thy fidelity,<br />
A covenant of health thou shalt have also of me.<br />
For Zion's sake now I will not hold my peace,<br />
And for Jerusalem, to speak will I not cease<br />
Till that righteous Lord become as a sunbeam bright,<br />
And their just saviour as a lamp extend his light.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;A rod shall shoot forth from the old stock of Jesse,<br />
And a bright blossom from that root will arise,<br />
Upon whom always the spir't of the Lord shall be,<br />
The spir't of wisdom, the spir't of heavenly practice,<br />
And the spir't that will all godliness devise.<br />
Take this for a sign, a maid of Israel<br />
Shall conceive and bear that Lord Emmanuel.</p>

<p><i>Esaias.</i> Thy praises condign no mortal tongue can tell,<br />
Most worthy maker and king of heavenly glory,<br />
For all capacities thy goodness doth excel,<br />
Thy plenteous graces no brain can compass truly,<br />
No wit can conceive the greatness of thy mercy,<br />
Declared of late in David thy true servant,<br />
And now confirmed in this thy later covenant.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of goodness thou madest Solomon of wit more pregnant,<br />
Asa and Josaphat, with good king Hezechiah,<br />
In thy sight to do that was to thee right pleasant.<br />
To quench idolatry thou raisedst up Elijah<br />
Jehu, Elisha, Micah, and Obdiah,<br />
The Syrian Naaman thou purgedst of a lepry<sup><a href="#fn_623" id="fna_623">623</a></sup><br />
Thy works wonderful who can but magnify?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Arise, Jerusalem, and take faith by and by,<sup><a href="#fn_624" id="fna_624">624</a></sup><br />
For the very light that shall save thee is coming.<br />
The Son of the Lord appear will evidently,<br />
When he shall resort, see that no joy be wanting.<br />
He is thy saviour, and thy life everlasting,<br />
Thy release from sin, and thy whole righteousness,<br />
Help me in this song t' acknowledge his great goodness.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Then in a tuneful voice he begins an antiphon, "O radix Jesse," which
the chorus follows with instruments.</i></p>

Gentiles worship as their heavenly Lord. Come now to deliver us, and<br />
delay the time no longer.</p>



<p>ACT VII</p>

<p>OF JOHN THE BAPTIST</p>


<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> I have with fierceness mankind oft-times corrected,<br />
And again I have allured him by sweet promise.<br />
I have sent sore plagues, when he hath me neglected,<br />
And then by and by, most comfortable sweetness.<br />
To win him to grace, both mercy and righteousness<br />
I have exercised, yet will he not amend.<br />
Shall I now lose him, or shall I him defend?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In his most mischief, most high grace will I send<br />
To overcome him by favour, if it may be.<br />
With his abuses no longer will I contend<br />
But now accomplish my first will and decree.<br />
My word being flesh, from hence shall set him free,<br />
Him teaching a way of perfect righteousness,<br />
That he shall not need to perish in his weakness.</p>

Ahaz and Ammon have now no more ado,<br />
Jechoniah with others who did themselves avert<br />
From thee to idols, may now no farther go.<br />
The two false judges, and Baal's wicked priests also,<br />
Phassur and Semaiah, with Nebuchadnosor,<br />
Antiochus and Triphon, shall thee displease no more.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Three score years and ten, thy people into Babylon<br />
Were captive and thrall for idols' worshipping.<br />
Jerusalem was lost, and left void of dominion,<br />
Burnt was their temple, so was their other building,<br />
Their high priests were slain, their treasure came to nothing;<br />
The strength and beauty of thine own heritage,<br />
Thus didst thou leave them in miserable bondage.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft had they warnings, sometimes by Ezekiel<br />
And other prophets, as Isay and Jeremy,<br />
Sometimes by Daniel, sometimes by Hosea and Joel,<br />
By Amos and Abdiah, by Jonah and Sophonya,<sup><a href="#fn_625" id="fna_625">625</a></sup><br />
By Nahum and Micah, Haggai and by Zachary,<br />
By Malachias, and also by Habakkuk,<br />
By Olda the widow, and by the prophet Baruch.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember Josiah, who took the abomination<br />
From the people, then restoring the laws again.<br />
Of Rahab consider the faithful generation,<br />
Whom to wine drinking no friendship might constrain.<br />
Remember Abimelech, the friend of truth certain,<br />
Zerubabel the prince, who did repair the temple,<br />
And Jesus Josedech, of virtue the example.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider Nehemiah, and Esdras the good scribe,<br />
Merciful Tobias, and constant Mardocheus;<sup><a href="#fn_626" id="fna_626">626</a></sup><br />

Have mind of Eleazer, and then Joannes Hircanus,<br />
Weigh the earnest faith of this godly company,<br />
Though the other clean fall from thy memory.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> I will John, I will, for as I said before,<br />
Rigour and hardness I have now set apart,<br />
Minding from henceforth to win man evermore<br />
By wonderful kindness to break his stubborn heart,<br />
And change it from sin. For Christ shall suffer smart,<br />
In man's frail nature for his iniquity,<br />
This to make open, my messenger shalt thou be.</p>

<p><i>John the Baptist.</i> As thy pleasure is, so blessed Lord appoint me,<br />
For my health thou art, and my soul's felicity.</p>

Before thou wert born I thee endued with grace.<br />
In thy mother's womb wert thou sanctificate<br />
By my godly gift, and so confirmed in place,<br />
A prophet, to shew a way before the face<br />
Of my most dear son, who will come: then until<br />
Apply thee apace thine office to fulfil.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Preach to the people, rebuking their negligence,<br />
Dip them in water, acknowledging their offence;<br />
And say unto them, The kingdom of God doth come.</p>

<p><i>John the Baptist.</i> Unmeet, Lord, I am, <i>Quia puer ego sum</i>.<sup><a href="#fn_627" id="fna_627">627</a></sup><br />
And other than that, alas, I have no science<br />
Fit for that office, neither yet clean eloquence.</p>

<p><i>Pater C&oelig;lestis.</i> Thou shalt not say so, for I have given thee grace,<br />
Eloquence and age, to speak in desert place.<br />
Thou must do therefore as I shall thee advise,<br />
My appointed pleasure forth utter in any wise;<br />
My strong mighty words put I into thy mouth,<br />
Spare not, but speak them to east, west, north and south.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>God stretching out his hand, touches John's lips with his finger and
confers upon him a golden tongue.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Go now thy way forth, I shall thee never fail,<br />

Persuade the people, that they their sins bewail;<br />
And if they repent their customable folly,<br />
Long shall it not be ere they have remedy.<br />
Open thou their hearts: tell them their health is coming<br />
As a voice in a desert; see thou declare the thing.<br />

Super eum, hic est qui baptizat spiritu sancto:</i><br />
Among all other whom thou shalt baptise there<br />
Upon whom thou seest the Holy Ghost descend<br />
In shape of a dove, resting upon his shoulder,<br />
Hold him for the same, that shall the world amend,<br />
By baptism of spirit, and also to man extend<br />
Most special grace. For he must repair his fall,<br />
Restoring again the justice original.<br />
Take now thy journey, and do as I thee advise,<br />
First preach repentance, and then the people baptise.</p>

<p><i>John the Baptist.</i> High honour, worship, and glory be unto thee,<br />
My God eternal, and patron of all purity.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Repent good people, for sins that now are past,<br />
The kingdom of heaven is at hand very nigh.<br />
The promised light to you approacheth fast,<br />
Have faith, and apply now to receive him boldly.<br />
I am not the light, but to bear testimony<br />
Of him am sent, that all men may believe,<br />
That his blood he will for their redemption give.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;He is such a light as all men doth illumine,<br />
That ever were here, or shall be after this.<br />
All the world he made by his mighty power divine,<br />
And yet that rude world will not know what he is.<br />
His own he entering, is not regarded of his.<br />
They that receive him, are God's true children plain,<br />
In spir't regenerate, and all grace shall attain.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Many do reckon, that I John Baptist am he,<br />
Deceived are they, and that will appear in space.<br />
Though he come after, yet he was long afore me.<br />
We are weak vessels, he is the well of grace,<br />
Of his great goodness all that we have we purchase.<br />
By him are we like to have a better increase<br />
Than ever we had by the laws of Moses.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For Moses' hard law we had not else but darkness,<br />
Figure and shadow, all was not else but night,<br />
Punishment for sin, much rigour, pain, and roughness,<br />
An high charge is there, where all is turned to light,<br />
Grace and remission anon will shine full bright.<br />
Never man lived that ever saw God afore,<br />
Which now in our kind man's ruin will restore.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Help me to give thanks to that Lord evermore,<br />
Which am unto Christ a crier in the desert,<br />
To prepare the paths and high ways him before<br />
For his delight is on the poor, simple heart.<br />

openest and no man sperith,<sup><a href="#fn_628" id="fna_628">628</a></sup> thou speakest and no man openeth; come<br />
and deliver thy servant mankind, bound in prison, sitting in the<br />
darkness of sin and bitter damnation.</p>



<p>EPILOGUE</p>


<p><i>Baleus Prolocutor.</i> The matters are such as we have uttered here,<br />
As ought not to slide from your memorial;<br />
For they have opened such comfortable gear,<br />
As is to the health of this kind universal,<br />
Graces of the Lord and promises liberal,<br />
Which he given to man for every age,<br />
To knit him to Christ, and so clear him of bondage.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;As St. Paul doth write unto the Corinthes<sup><a href="#fn_629" id="fna_629">629</a></sup> plain,<br />
Our forefathers were under the cloud of darkness,<br />
And unto Christ's days did in the shadow remain;<br />
Yet were they not left, for of him they had promise<br />
All they received one spiritual feeding doubtless.<br />
They drank of the rock which them to life refreshed,<br />
For one saving health, in Christ, all they confessed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the woman's seed was Adam first justified,<br />
So was faithful Noah, so was just Abraham;<br />
The faith in that seed in Moses forth multiplied,<br />
Likewise in David and Esaye<sup><a href="#fn_630" id="fna_630">630</a></sup> that after came,<br />
And in John Baptist, which shewed the very Lamb.<br />
Though they so afar, yet all they had one justice<br />
One mass, as they call it, and in Christ one sacrifice.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;A man cannot here to God do better service,<br />
Than on this to ground his faith and understanding.<br />
For all the world's sin alone Christ payed the price,<br />
In his only death was man's life always resting,<br />
And not in will--works, nor yet in men's deserving,<br />
The light of our faith makes this thing evident,<br />
And not the practice of other experiment.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is now free will, which the hypocrites comment?<br />
Whereby they report they may at their own pleasure<br />
Do good of themselves, though grace and faith be absent,<br />
And have good intents their madness with to measure.<br />
The will of the flesh is proved here small treasure,<br />
And so is man's will, for the grace of God doth all.<br />
More of this matter conclude hereafter we shall.</p>

<p>Thus endeth this tragedy or interlude, manifesting the chief promises of
God unto Man by all ages in the old law, from the fall of Adam to the
incarnation of the Lord Jesus Christ. Compiled by John Bayle. Anno
Domini 1538.</p>

I hope old Father Christmas<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will never be forgot.</p>

<p>I am not come here to laugh or to jeer,<br />
But for a pocketfull of money, and a skinfull of beer,<br />
If you will not believe what I do say,<br />
Come in, the King of Egypt!--clear the way!</p>

<p class="stagedir"><i>Enter the King of Egypt.</i></p>

<p>Here I, the King of Egypt, boldly do appear,<br />
St. George, St. George, walk in, my only son and heir.<br />
Walk in, my son St. George, and boldly act thy part,<br />
That all the people here may see thy wond'rous art.</p>

<p class="stagedir"><i>Enter Saint George.</i></p>

<p>Here come I, St. George, from Britain did I spring,<br />
I'll fight the Dragon bold, my wonders to begin.<br />
I'll clip his wings, he shall not fly;<br />
I'll cut him down, or else I die.</p>

<p class="stagedir"><i>Enter the Dragon.</i></p>

<p>Who's he that seeks the Dragon's blood,<br />
And calls so angry, and so loud?<br />
That English dog, will he before me stand?<br />
I'll cut him down with my courageous hand.<br />
With my long teeth, and scurvy jaw,<br />
Of such I'd break up half a score,<br />
And stay my stomach, till I'd more.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>St. George and the Dragon fight, the latter is killed.</i></p>

<p><i>Father Christmas.</i> Is there a doctor to be found<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;All ready, near at hand,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;And make the champion stand.</p>

<p class="stagedir"><i>Enter Doctor.</i></p>

<p>Oh! yes, there is a doctor to be found<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All ready, near at hand,<br />
To cure a deep and deadly wound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make the champion stand.</p>

<p><i>Father Christmas.</i> What can you cure?</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> All sorts of diseases,<br />
Whatever you pleases,<br />
The phthisic, the palsy, and the gout;<br />
If the devil's in, I'll blow him out.</p>

<p><i>Father Christmas.</i> What is your fee?</p>

<p><i>Doctor.</i> Fifteen pound, it is my fee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money to lay down.<br />
But, as 'tis such a rogue as thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cure for ten pound.</p>

<p>I carry a little bottle of alicumpane;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here Jack, take a little of my flip flop,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pour it down thy tip top;<br />
Rise up and fight again.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>The Doctor performs his cure, the fight is renewed, and the Dragon
again killed.</i></p>

<p><i>Saint George.</i> Here am I, St. George,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That worthy champion bold,<br />
And with my sword and spear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I won three crowns of gold.<br />
I fought the fiery dragon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And brought him to the slaughter;<br />
By that I won fair Sabra,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of Egypt's daughter.<br />
Where is the man, that now will me defy?<br />
I'll cut his giblets full of holes, and make his buttons fly.</p>

<p class="stagedir"><i>The Turkish Knight advances.</i></p>

<p>Here come I, the Turkish Knight,<br />
Come from the Turkish land to fight.<br />
I'll fight St. George, who is my foe,<br />
I'll make him yield before I go;<br />
He brags to such a high degree,<br />
He thinks there's none can do the like of he.</p>

<p><i>Saint George.</i> Where is the Turk, that will before me stand?<br />
I'll cut him down with my courageous hand.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>They fight, the Knight is overcome, and falls on one knee.</i></p>

<p><i>Turkish Knight.</i> Oh! pardon me, St. George, pardon of thee I crave,<br />
Oh! pardon me this night, and I will be thy slave.</p>

<p><i>Saint George.</i> No pardon shalt thou have, while I have foot to stand,<br />
So rise thee up again, and fight out sword in hand.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>They fight again, and the Knight is killed. Father Christmas calls for
the Doctor, with whom the same dialogue occurs as before, and the cure<br />
is performed.</i></p>

<p>Here come I, the Giant, bold Turpin is my name,<br />
And all the nations round do tremble at my fame.<br />
Where'er I go, they tremble at my sight,<br />
No lord or champion long with me would fight.</p>

<p><i>Saint George.</i> Here's one that dares to look thee in the face,<br />
And soon will send thee to another place.</p>

<p class="stagedir"><i>They fight, and the Giant is killed; medical aid is called in as
before, and the cure performed by the Doctor, to whom then is given a
basin of girdy grout and a kick, and driven out.</i></p>

<p><i>Father Christmas.</i> Now, ladies and gentlemen, your sport is most ended,<br />
So prepare for the hat, which is highly commended.<br />
The hat it would speak, if it had but a tongue;<br />
Come throw in your money, and think it no wrong.</p>

<h3>FROM THE CORNISH MYSTERY OF THE CRUCIFIXION</h3>


<p><i>Jesus.</i> Woman, seest thou thy son?<br />
A thousand times your arms have borne him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;With tenderness.<br />
And John, behold thy mother;<br />
Thus keep her, without denial,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as ye live.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Alas! alas! oh! sad, sad!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In my heart is sorrow,<br />
When I see my son Jesus,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;About his head a crown of thorns<br />
He is Son of God in every way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And with that truly a King;<br />
Feet and hands on every side<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast fixed with nails of iron.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas!<br />
That one shall have on the day of judgment<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy doom, flesh and blood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who hath sold him.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> O sweet mother, do not bear sorrow,<br />
For always, in every way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be prepared for thee:<br />
The will of thy Son is so,<br />
For to save so much as is good,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Adam was created.</p>

<p><i>Jesus.</i> O Father, Eli, Eloy, &middot; lama sabacthani?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art my dear God,<br />
Why hast thou left me &middot; a moment alone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In any manner?</p>

<p><i>1st Executioner.</i> He is calling Elias;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch now diligently<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he comes to save <i>him</i>.<br />
If he delivers him, really<br />
We will believe in him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And worship him ever.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Here a sponge is made ready, with gall and vinegar. And then the
Centurion stands in his tent, and says:</i></p>

<p><i>Centurion.</i> I will go to see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;How it is with dear Jesus:<br />
It were a pity on a good man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;So much contumely to be cast.<br />
If he were a bad man, his fellow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Could not in any way<br />
Truly have such great grace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;To save men by one word.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>The Centurion goes down.</i></p>

<p><i>2nd Executioner.</i> It is not Elias whom he called;<br />
Thirst surely on him there is,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;He finds it an evil thing.          <span class="stagedir">[<i>He holds out a sponge</i></span><br />
Behold here I have me ready,<br />
Gall <i>and</i> hyssop mixed;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wassail, if there is great thirst.</p>

<p><i>Jesus.</i> Thirst on me there is.</p>

<p><i>3rd Executioner.</i> See, a drink for thee here;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why dost thou not drink it?<br />
Rather shouldst thou a wonder work!<br />
Now, come down from the cross,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And we will worship thee.</p>

<p><i>Jesus.</i> O Father, into thy hands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I commit my spirit;<br />
By thy will take it to thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;As thou sent it into the world.</p>

<p>Reverende lordes and ladyes all,

That sometymes there was mayor of this citie,
Sir John Arnway, Knyghte, who most worthilye
Contented himselfe to set out an playe
The devise of one Done Randali, moonke of Chester Abbey.</p>

<p>"This moonke, moonke-like, in scriptures well seene,
In storyes travelled with the best sorte;
In pagentes set fourth, apparently to all eyne,
The Olde and Newe Testament with livelye comforte;
Intermynglinge therewith, onely to make sporte,
Some things not warranted by any writt,
Which to gladd the hearers he woulde men to take yt.</p>

<p>"This matter he abrevited into playes twenty-foure,
And every playe of the matter gave but a taste,
Leavinge for better learninges circumstances to accomplishe,
For his proceedinges maye appeare to be in haste:
Yet all together unprofitable his labour he did not waste,
For at this daye, and ever, he deserveth the fame
Which all moonkes deserve professinge that name.</p>

<hr />

This order toke, as declare to you I shall,

These pagentes shoulde be played affter breeffe rehearsall;
For every pagente a cariage to be provyded withall,
In which sorte we purpose this Whitsontyde,
Our pagentes into three partes to devyde.</p>

<p>"Now you worshippful <span class="smallcaps">Tanners</span> that of custume olde
The fall of Lucifer did set out,
Some writers awarrante your matter, therefore be boulde
Lustelye to playe the same to all the rowtte;
And yf any thereof stand in any doubte,
Your author his author hath, your shewe let bee,
Good speech, fyne players, with apparill comelye.</p>

<p>"The good symple water-leaders and drawers of deey,
See that your Arke in all poyntes be prepared;
Of Noy and his children the wholl storye,
And of the universall floude, by you shalbe played.</p>

<p>"The Sacrifice that faithfull Abraham of his sonne should make,
You barbers and waxe-chaundlers of Aunciente tyme,
In the fourth pageante with paines you doe take,
In decente sorte set out--the storie is ffine--
The offeringe of Melchesedecke of breade and wine,
And the presentacion therof set in your playe,
Suffer you not in any poynte the story to decaye.</p>



<h4>III.--<span class="smallcaps">Cornish Miracle Plays</span></h4>


<h5>[<i>From Norris's "Ancient Cornish Drama"</i>]</h5>

<p>We have no notice of the performance of the Cornish plays earlier than
that of Richard Carew, whose survey of Cornwall was first printed in
1602. In his time they even played in regular amphitheatres, and the
account he gives is well worth extracting, as it affords a vivid picture
by one who was in all probability an eye-witness, nearly three centuries
ago. "The quasy miracle, in English, a miracle play, is a kinde of
interlude, compiled in Cornish out of some Scripture history, with that
grossenes which accompanied the Romanes <i>vetus Comedia</i>. For
representing it, they raise an earthen amphitheatre in some open field,
having the Diameter of his enclosed playne some 40 or 50 foot. The
Country people flock from all sides, many miles off to hear and see it;
for they have therein devils and devices, to delight as well the eye as
the eare; the players conne not their parts without booke, but are
prompted by one called the Ordinary, who followeth at their back with
the booke in his hand, and telleth them softly what they must pronounce
aloud."</p>

<p>Writing a century and a half later than Carew, Dr. Borlase describes the
amphitheatres in which these Cornish plays were given; more particularly
one in the parish of St. Just near the Land's End. This <i>round</i> as it
was popularly called, was "an exact circle of 126 feet in diameter; the
perpendicular height of the bank, from the area within, now seven feet;
but the height from the bottom of the ditch without, ten feet at
present, formerly more. The seats consist of six steps, fourteen inches
wide, and one foot high, with one on the top of all, when the rampart is
about seven feet wide." Another round or amphitheatre was described by
Dr. Borlase as a perfectly level area 130 feet across, and surrounded by
an earthen mound eight feet high.</p>

<p>In such magnificent surroundings of open-air, picturesque country, sea,
and sky, were these curious plays given to instruct and edify a
multitude drawn at large from the country-side, which often must remain
camped for two or three days in the neighbourhood to see the
performances out.</p>


<h4>IV.--<span class="smallcaps">From "The Cornish Drama," by Henry Jenner</span></h4>

<h5>(<i>Celtic Review</i>, April 1907)</h5>

<p>"The trilogy known as the <i>Ordinalia</i> consists of:--(<i>a</i>) <i>Origo Mundi</i>,
which begins with the Creation of the World, ... and ends with the
building of Solomon's Temple; (<i>b</i>) <i>Passio Domini</i>, which represents
the Temptation of Christ and the events from the Entry into Jerusalem
to the Entombment; (<i>c</i>) <i>Resurrectio Domini</i>, which gives the story of
the Harrowing of Hell, ... the Resurrection, and the events between the
Resurrection and the Ascension with which it ends. Interpolated in the
middle is the Legend of St. Veronica, and Tiberius, and the Death of
Pilate. Running through all three is the old legend of the Origin of the
Wood of the Cross." (Our two Mysteries are from "<i>C</i>").</p>


<h4>V.--<span class="smallcaps">Contemporary Account of Sir David Lindsay's "Satire of the Three
Estates"</span></h4>

<h5>(<i>From a Letter Written by Sir Wm. Eure, 26th Jan. 1540</i>)</h5>

<p>"In the feast of Ephipane at Lightgowe, before the king, queene, and the
whole counsaile, spirituall and temporall.--In the firste entres come in
Solace (whose parte was but to make mery, sing ballets with his
fellowes, and drink at the interluydes of the play), whoe showed firste
to all the audience the play to be played. Next come in a king, who
passed to his throne, having nae speche to thende of the play, and then
to ratify and approve, as in Parliament, all things done by the rest of
the players, which represented <span class="smallcaps">The Three Estates</span>. With him came his
cortiers, <span class="smallcaps">Placebo</span>, <span class="smallcaps">Picthank</span>, and <span class="smallcaps">Flatterye</span>, and sic alike gard: one
swering he was the lustiest, starkeste, best proportionit, and most
valeyant man that ever was; and ane other swore he was the beste with
long-bowe, crosse-bowe, and culverin, and so fourth. Thairafter there
come a man armed in harness, with a swerde drawn in his hande, a <span class="smallcaps">Bushop</span>,
a <span class="smallcaps">Burgesman</span>, and <span class="smallcaps">Experience</span>, clede like a <span class="smallcaps">Doctor</span>; who set them all down
on the deis under the <span class="smallcaps">King</span>. After them come a <span class="smallcaps">Poor Man</span>, who did go up
and down the scaffolde, making a hevie complainte that he was hereyet,
throw the courtiers taking his fewe in one place, and his tackes in
another; wherthrough he had sceyled his house, his wyfe and childrene
beggyng thair brede, and so of many thousands in Scotland; saying thair
was no remedy to be gotten, as he was neither acquainted with controller
nor treasurer. And then he looked to the King, and said he was not king
in Scotland, fore there was ane other king in Scotland that hanged <span class="smallcaps">Johne
Armstrang</span>, with his fellowes, <span class="smallcaps">Sym the Laird</span>, and mony other mae; but he
had lefte ane thing undone. Then he made a long narracione of the
oppression of the poor, by the taking of the corse-presaunte beists, and
of the herrying of poor men by the consistorye lawe, and of many other
abusions of the <span class="smallcaps">Spiritualitie</span> and Church. Then the <span class="smallcaps">Bushop</span> raise and
rebuked him. Then the <span class="smallcaps">Man of Armes</span> alledged the contraire, and commanded
the poor man to go on. The poor man proceeds with a long list of the
bushop's evil practices, the vices of cloisters, etc. This proved by
<span class="smallcaps">Experience</span>, who, from a New Testament, shows the office of a bushop. The
<span class="smallcaps">Man of Armes</span> and the <span class="smallcaps">Burges</span> approve of all that was said against the
clergy, and alledge the expediency of a reform, with the consent of
Parliament. The <span class="smallcaps">Bushop</span> dissents. The <span class="smallcaps">Man of Armes</span> and the <span class="smallcaps">Burges</span> said
they were two, and he but one, wherefore their voice should have most
effect. Thereafter the King, in the play, ratified, approved, and
confirmed all that was rehearsed."</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
